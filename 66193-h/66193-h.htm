<br />VINNIE&rsquo;S PERIL.</h2>
<p>The scene of our story is laid in the great North-west.</p>
<p>It was a bleak, windy day in November. The shrill blasts
wailed through the forest trees like the last despairing cry of
a lost spirit, and gust after gust beat and roared around the
little log cabin standing so silent and lonely, half buried in
the midst of the Titanic oaks that spread their long branches
protectingly over its low roof, and whose sturdy trunks environed
it, seeming to keep silent and untiring guard over its
four rough walls.</p>
<p>The scene within the cabin was in striking contrast with
the wild aspect without.</p>
<p>It was a rude but homelike place, and despite the chinked
walls and rough furniture, there was such an air of plain comfort
as one might expect to see in the abode of the sturdy
western pioneer.</p>
<p>A young girl sat by a table engaged in embroidering a
broad strip of dressed deer-skin with fancifully colored beads
and quills&mdash;a blue-eyed, slender-looking little woman with
shining masses of golden-brown hair falling unconfined about
her small, shapely head, and down over her shoulders until
it reached the waist of her dress, which fitted her willowy
form to perfection, and whose ample folds half concealed,
half disclosed a small, neatly-clad foot and well-turned ankle.</p>
<p>Her sunny blue eyes held a soft, loving light, and a bright
smile played continually upon her dainty face and around her
rosy little mouth, with its ripe lips half parted from the rows
of small white teeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>But the azure eyes could flash with courage and determination,
and the pretty mouth could be hard and stern with its
strawberry lips tightly drawn and its tiny, gleaming teeth
hard-set.</p>
<p>The settler&rsquo;s daughter was very lovely, and she possessed a
nerve and courage far beyond her sex.</p>
<p>A tall, powerfully-made man of fifty stood near the great
wide-mouthed fire-place, in which a ruddy blaze leapt and
glowed fantastically, shedding a pleasant radiance over the
homely place that could not but be grateful to one who, like
Emmett Darke, was preparing to leave it and go out into the
wind and cold of the chill November day. But the settler,
long used to the perils of border life, thought little of
this.</p>
<p>His sharp gray eye and firm through pleasant mouth bespoke
indomitable courage and strength of will; and as he
stood there in the red glow of the dancing firelight, buckling
on his deer-skin belt in which he thrust the borderman&rsquo;s trusty
companion, a long, keen-edged hunting-knife, with a brace of
heavy pistols, he looked the personification of the ideal hunter
of the far western wilds.</p>
<p>A huge blood-hound lay on the floor at his feet&mdash;a large,
red-eyed creature with white, gleaming teeth&mdash;a brute that
might be a true and faithful friend, but could not but be a
terribly dangerous enemy.</p>
<p>The object in the room most likely to attract the attention
of a casual observer was a small square box of polished wood,
standing on the table.</p>
<p>Besides the tall clock ticking in a corner, this casket was
the only visible thing that bore evidence of having been made
by hands more skilled than those of the settler, or with tools
other than those common implements ever ready at the pioneer&rsquo;s
grasp, the ax and the auger.</p>
<p>What this curious little box contained, will appear hereafter.</p>
<p>Soon the hunter&rsquo;s preparations were completed, and slinging
a long rifle, which he had taken down from its place on
three pegs in the wall, across his shoulders, he turned to his
daughter who had wound the soft deer-skin belt, upon which
she had wrought innumerable fancy devices, gracefully about
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
her waist and shoulders, and stood regarding him with a
merry light sparkling in her blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I look, papa?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Like some dusky
forest princess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she finished by placing a jaunty turban in which were
fastened several bright-colored plumes, which drooped down
until they touched her beautiful golden hair, coquettishly on
her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More like a regular angel, wings and all!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
admiringly: for Emmett Darke loved his beautiful motherless
child more than his life. &ldquo;That hair and those eyes of
yours don&rsquo;t look very Injiny. Wouldn&rsquo;t that red lover of
yours go wild if he saw you now? I don&rsquo;t wonder he&rsquo;s half-crazy
and calls you &lsquo;Sun-Hair!&rsquo; How about that youngster,
Clancy Vere, eh, Vinnie? Has he an eye to beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maiden blushed rosy red; but the laughing eyes became
thoughtful in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, papa, that I often think of him&mdash;the Indian?
Oh, if he should come some day when you are gone!
He is wild and bloodthirsty and his passions are ungovernable.
He has taken a solemn vow to make me his wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall never fulfill that vow!&rdquo; cried the old man, with
a dangerous light in his cold gray eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have his life,
first! If he comes here again I&rsquo;ll give him a free pass to the
happy hunting-grounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emmett Darke&rsquo;s face was almost white with rage, and he
brought the heavy stock of his long rifle down on the floor
with a sharp bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so sure as that red devil has the misfortune to be
caught anywhere near my cabin, I will shoot him down like
the coward he is! My daughter is never to become a squaw,
eh, Vinnie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, father! Never will I become the Indian&rsquo;s wife!
I would sooner shed my own heart&rsquo;s blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke so calmly and yet determinedly that her father
half-shuddered. He knew that she meant every word, and
he breathed an inward prayer that God would watch over his
lonely child and guard her from all peril during his absence.</p>
<p>The hunter stood silent and motionless for a few moments,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
thinking intently. Arousing himself at length, he said, turning
to the blood-hound, who was on his feet in an instant, running
around him and licking his hands:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Death! We must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes they had passed out, and were walking
rapidly and silently through the forest.</p>
<p>As Darke went away, a face appeared among the thick
bushes close by the cabin&mdash;a red face, hideously daubed with
black and yellow paint, with long, coarse black hair, hanging
down the sunken jaws, and fierce black eyes flashing triumph
and exultation as the hunter disappeared from view.
Darke did not see this face, and the bushes closed over it in
a moment, concealing it as suddenly as it had appeared.</p>
<p>After her father was gone, Vinnie went and stood before
the fireplace, looking down into the red mass of leaping
flames.</p>
<p>She was deeply buried in thought, and she heard no sound
save the hissing of the fire and the wailing of the wind
around the corners of the cabin, and through the bare branches
of the great oaks outside.</p>
<p>She little thought what a lovely picture she made as she
stood thus, silent and motionless&mdash;one might almost imagine
breathless&mdash;with a dreamy, far-off look in her soft eyes, and
the glancing blaze lighting up her fair face till she looked, in
fantastic guise, like some beautified Fairy queen, some incomparable
silvan goddess.</p>
<p>Rarely, radiantly lovely she appeared, strangely out of
place in that homely room.</p>
<p>She was unconscious of this&mdash;unconscious, also, of another
presence in the cabin until the back-log fell suddenly with a
dull thud, throwing out a shower of red sparks and arousing
her on the instant from the fit of abstraction into which she
had fallen.</p>
<p>With a quick start, she turned her head and saw a tall
form close behind her&mdash;so near that it might easily have
touched her.</p>
<p>It was the form of an Indian, powerful and massive. The
face was the same that had peered through the shrubbery at
Emmett Darke a few minutes before.</p>
<p>There was a strange light glowing in the fierce eyes fixed
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
so steadily on the lovely face before him&mdash;a look of wild
passion as dangerous as it was intense.</p>
<p>The savage did not speak nor even stir; but the hard, cruel
lines on his forehead and about his mouth relaxed a little as
he tried to twist his ugly visage into the semblance of a smile&mdash;a
semblance that was even more loathsome than its habitual
scowl&mdash;that was nearer the leer of an exultant fiend than the
smile of a human being.</p>
<p>Vinnie&rsquo;s face was deathly pale, and her heart seemed for a
moment to lay still in her bosom; but she tried to meet the
gaze of those devilish eyes calmly. She stood quite still, looking
into the cruel face, but she dared not trust her voice.</p>
<p>The Indian spoke at length, in a tone harsh and rasping,
like the snarl of some wild animal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ku-nan-gu-no-nah has come for his squaw. Sun-Hair is
very beautiful. Ku-nan-gu-no-nah is a mighty warrior. He
has always loved the white maiden since he met her in the
forest many moons ago. The great chief&rsquo;s heart has been
burning for Sun-Hair. He has prepared his wigwam. It is
hung around with the scalps of his slain foes. Sun-Hair will
be a queen. The Indian women will bow down their heads
in shame before the beautiful Sun-Hair! Is she ready?
Will she go with the great chief? His warriors are waiting
to see their queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Vinnie did not speak, then the words came
clear and sharp from her white lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I will never go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief&rsquo;s face was fairly demoniac in an instant&mdash;the
sickish leer was gone, and the savage teeth shone through the
drawn lips in two white, gleaming rows. He advanced with
a quick motion, and laid his hand roughly on her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said the harsh voice, &ldquo;Sun-Hair must go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />CLANCY VERE AND HIS TROUBLE.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a young man who spoke, standing on the bank of
a small stream that had its course through the forest at a
point about two miles distant, as a bird flies, from Emmett
Darke&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>He was tall and well-formed, with hazel eyes and dark-brown
hair. His face was clear-cut and handsome, open and
frank in its expression, while it indicated a goodly stock of
firmness and courage.</p>
<p>This is Clancy Vere, the young hunter, an allusion to
whom had brought the rich blood to Vinnie&rsquo;s face that very
afternoon.</p>
<p>He was clad in a complete suit of dressed deer-skin, elaborately
ornamented about the shoulders with bright-colored
beads and quills, his hunting-shirt being gathered about his
waist with a wide belt from which protruded the stock of a
heavy revolver and the silver-mounted hilt of a long bowie-knife,
while a powder-horn and bullet-pouch were slung by a
leathern cord under his left arm.</p>
<p>As he spoke, he dropped the butt of his rifle, a trim, beautifully-mounted
weapon, until it rested on the turf at his feet;
then he stood leaning on it for a long time, looking intently
down into the depths of the eddying stream before him.</p>
<p>He was thinking&mdash;of a girl with blue eyes and golden
brown hair&mdash;of Emmett Darke&rsquo;s beautiful daughter, Vinnie.</p>
<p>Clancy Vere loved Vinnie devotedly, and not hopelessly,
she had led him to think; though, as yet, he had never made
any formal declaration of his passion.</p>
<p>Still, as a look is oftentimes fraught with more meaning
than the most high-sounding speech, and the pioneer&rsquo;s daughter
had not, upon certain occasions which he could recall,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
been chary of these looks, Vere was very far from being despondent.</p>
<p>He lived at a small settlement a half-dozen miles away, and
had set out that morning to visit the cabin of the hunter.
His errand there may be easily surmised.</p>
<p>He had proceeded thus far on his way without adventure
worthy of note, and intended to cross the stream in a canoe
that he knew Darke kept concealed in the undergrowth at a
place a hundred yards below the spot where he now stood.</p>
<p>So intent was he upon his musings, that he heard no sound
save the rippling of the water and the roar of the wind
through the trees.</p>
<p>He did not see the bushes part close behind him and a
dusky form emerge from its concealment, to be followed by
another, then another, until six Indians had entered the little
grassy space in which he was standing, and began stealthily
to take different positions around him until his chances of
escape were cut off on all sides.</p>
<p>He was brought to realize his situation in a moment.</p>
<p>A chorus of shrill, exultant yells rung out on every hand.</p>
<p>He turned on the instant, and his quick eye measured the
strength of his savage foes. They were too near at hand for
him to bring his rifle to bear; but gripping it firmly around
the barrel, he brought the ponderous stock down on his nearest
assailant, crushing in his skull like an egg-shell.</p>
<p>There was a muffled thud as the deadly weight fell a second
time, and another savage sunk over on the ground without
a groan.</p>
<p>An Indian was creeping up stealthily behind him. As
Vere raised his clubbed rifle a third time, throwing it high
above his head, in order that the blow might be more effective,
the savage, who had been crouching down on the ground
a moment close beside him, sprung high in the air, and clutching
the gun-barrel near the lock, wrenched it from the young
hunter&rsquo;s hands just as it began to descend.</p>
<p>This quick, hard pull upon the weapon, which he gripped
with all his strength, caused him to stagger a trifle, and before
he could regain his footing and draw his bowie-knife,
the three remaining Indians sprung upon him and bore him
to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>In a moment his elbows were pinioned behind his back,
and his weapons were transferred from his belt to those of
his captors.</p>
<p>They pulled him roughly to his feet, and an Indian took
his place on either side, leading him along by the arms. The
brave who had disarmed him walked behind, while the remaining
savage, who was evidently a warrior of some importance,
to judge from the number of eagle&rsquo;s feathers which ornamented
his head and the many trophies of the war-path
and the chase which were hung about his neck and secured
to his belt, led the way up the stream, pausing ever and anon
to give some guttural command in his native dialect to his
followers, who clutched their captive&rsquo;s arms firmly, as if they
feared that, bound and almost helpless as he was, he would
attempt to escape.</p>
<p>They had seen evidence of his prowess, and wisely concluded
that he was a safer prisoner well guarded than when allowed
to walk alone.</p>
<p>For an hour they kept on, over fallen trees and heaps of
rock, through tangled masses of undergrowth, now bearing a
little to the right, then to the left; but always keeping within
hearing of the stream, whose monotonous murmurings seemed
to grow louder and hoarser as they proceeded, until they
changed to a wild, sullen roar, like the impetuous rushing and
dashing of a cataract.</p>
<p>At length, after a long silence, the leader of the party
turned toward Vere and said, impressively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the pale-face hear the song of the waterfall? It
is chanting his death-song! The black waters laugh because
they will swallow up the pale-face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the sun appeared through an opening in the leaden
gray clouds that had drifted lazily through the sky until they
were gathered together in a dark, lowering mass overhead,
and its bright rays trembled for a moment upon the surface
of the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; continued the Indian, pointing to the falls just visible
through the trees. &ldquo;See the waters smile! They laugh
because the red men will give them a pale-face victim! Let
the white man hear them sing! &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;the
pale-face must die!&rsquo; It is his death chant! The great
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Manitou is speaking through the laughing waters. He is
happy with his red children when a pale-face dies. The
white hunter is brave. He is not afraid to fight. But his
heart will grow small within his bosom when he must go
down into the black waters&mdash;the river of death! Will he be
brave when he meets the unknown dangers of the dark valley?
He will find it hard to die now. He is young and the
world looks bright to his eyes. Perhaps a white woman will
weep when he is dead. The Indian women have mourned
for their husbands and brothers when they have gone out to
fight the Long-knives and never returned. The laughing
waters are crying aloud for their victim. The white man
must die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all must die,&rdquo; said Vere, calmly, not caring to show
the concern he really felt. &ldquo;Men have died before, why should
I fear death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An expression of surprise flitted over the Indian&rsquo;s painted
face.</p>
<p>Few men could meet death so calmly.</p>
<p>The young hunter had resolved not to die without a desperate
struggle; but he preferred that his captors should
think him resigned to his fate&mdash;the horrible fate which
seemed inevitable.</p>
<p>A few rods above the falls a tree grew far out over the
water, rushing madly to the cataract below.</p>
<p>The bank at this point was rough and jagged, its steep and
rocky sides jutting out full twenty feet above the black, roaring
mass underneath.</p>
<p>The party halted here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pale-face hunter&rsquo;s feet must be tied,&rdquo; said the Indian
who had spoken before. &ldquo;He must not fight with the
laughing waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Producing a stout leathern thong, about twelve feet in
length, one of the savages advanced to coil it around the captive&rsquo;s
ankles.</p>
<p>As he stooped, Vere drew his foot back suddenly and
planted it with tremendous force squarely in his face, flattening
his long nose and knocking out several of his sharp white
teeth.</p>
<p>The Indian rolled over on the ground with a wild screech.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The pain was terrible, and he lay for a moment, pressing
his disfigured face and giving utterance to a series of hoarse,
agonized groans.</p>
<p>Then he sprung up suddenly with a wild yell of rage and
vengeance.</p>
<p>He was upon Vere in an instant, his long fingers entwined
in his hair and his scalping-knife circling with lightning rapidity
around his head.</p>
<p>The young hunter&rsquo;s arms were securely pinioned.</p>
<p>He was utterly powerless in the red fiend&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>Death&mdash;sudden and terrible&mdash;seemed certain; but he did
not flinch.</p>
<p>His fearless eye was fixed on the Indian&rsquo;s face, and his own
did not change when he felt the keen knife-point pricking
the skin upon the crown of his head.</p>
<p>He was not afraid to die.</p>
<p>He thought of the terrible, because unknown life beyond
the grave&mdash;and of Vinnie!</p>
<p>Would she weep when he was gone?</p>
<p>He trusted so, and stood calmly awaiting the great change.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />VINNIE&rsquo;S STRATAGEM.</h2>
<p>Vinnie&rsquo;s face was very pale, but she did not cry out. A
wild fear, an awful terror, was tugging at her heart, but she
would not give way to it. She knew she would need all her
native courage and coolness in the ordeal which she foresaw
she must endure.</p>
<p>Ku-nan-gu-no-nah&rsquo;s hand retained its rough grip on her
arm, and his harsh voice repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come. Sun-Hair must go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Resistance would, she knew, be of no avail. It would
only serve to arouse the Indian&rsquo;s passions to a still higher pitch
of intensity&mdash;to make him, if possible, still more demoniac, and
still more determined than ever to fulfill his vow, and carry
out his intention to abduct and bear her away to his wigwam.</p>
<p>She must have recourse to stratagem.</p>
<p>So, to gain time, she said as calmly as possible, but with
a wild throbbing at her heart which she tried in vain to still:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the great chief loves the pale-face maiden? He would
make her a queen? He would spend his whole life to make
her happy? Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, eagerly. &ldquo;Ku-nan-gu-no-nah loves Sun-Hair
as the bird loves its mate. He will always make her
happy. She shall never know what it is to weep. Her life
shall always be pleasant. It shall be like a day when the
green grass is new on the ground, and the dancing waters,
freed from their cold bonds of ice, are laughing in the bright
sunlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my life shall be like one long day in the bright
spring-time?&rdquo; she said, as bravely as she could, smiling through
all her fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; again said the chief, with a searching look in her
white face.</p>
<p>He had expected tears and opposition, and he received instead,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
smiles, and apparent acquiescence, and he was surprised
and partially thrown off his guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be the white maiden will go with her Indian lover,&rdquo;
said Vinnie. &ldquo;Give her time to think. It is very hard for her
to leave her home and her kind old father. Does the chief
think he can make Sun-Hair happier than she has been here?
Can he make her forget her father and her home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did not Ku-nan-gu-no-nah tell the beautiful Sun-Hair
that she should be a queen? She shall wear robes as dazzling
as the light of the sun. She need not work like the
Indian women. She need do nothing but sit and sing like a
bird all day long. The red-women will bow their heads in
shame before her bright face, and the warriors will sing songs
about her beauty. They will think of their beautiful queen
when they go on the war-path, and they will always return
with the scalps of their dead enemies hanging in their belts.
What more can Sun-Hair wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will go,&rdquo; said the girl, slowly. &ldquo;Only give me
time to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! It is well!&rdquo; grunted Ku-nan-gu-no-nah, with another
of his sickish smiles. Then frowning darkly, and with
a significant tap on the handle of his tomahawk:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Sun-Hair no fool the chief! If she does he will kill
her! She can&rsquo;t get away. Take care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian let her free now; and he sat down on a low
stool near the door, as if half fearing some treachery on Vinnie&rsquo;s
part, but he was pretty well assured, after all, that she
would go with him without much resistance. Vinnie stood
for some time, striving to think of some plan by which she
might escape the Indian, who watched her every motion
from under his heavy, overhanging brows, as closely as a cat
watches a mouse.</p>
<p>There was such a look of half-suspicious triumph on his
dark face and in his cruel eyes as is sometimes seen in the
eyes of the panther, as it sits quietly by, watching its prey,
and suffering it to live and exult in a few moments more of
life that the moment of its annihilation, when it comes suddenly
and unlooked for, may be the harder to bear.</p>
<p>But the poor girl rejected plan after plan as impracticable.
At one time she thought of making some excuse to

enter an adjoining apartment and secure a pistol which she
knew her father kept there; but she feared that the savage
would discover her intention and tomahawk her at once.
Then she contemplated making a rush for the door at the
cabin and escaping into the forest; but her reason told her
that the chief would overtake her before she was fairly outside
the door.</p>
<p>At last, when she had nearly given up in despair, a thought
suggested itself to her brain&mdash;how, she never knew, it was
so wild and strange&mdash;that made her heart leap with a newborn
hope&mdash;a hope that she might yet outwit her captor
and gain time until something&mdash;she know not what&mdash;should
intervene to save her from the fate he had marked out for
her.</p>
<p>She sat down by the table and opened the small box of
polished wood, of which mention was made in our first chapter,
the Indian watching her the while from his place near
the door.</p>
<p>This casket, on being opened, prove to be a small galvanic
battery; and Vinnie was but a moment preparing it for action.</p>
<p>When all was in readiness, she took a pair of electric slippers
from a drawer in the table and placed them beside the
battery.</p>
<p>Then, knowing the superstition of the Indian race, she
arose, and waving her hands several times very slowly around
her head, seemed to be invoking a charm. Her eyes were
fixed apparently on vacancy, and she stood motionless for
several minutes; then smiling sweetly, she turned to Ku-nan-gu-no-nah,
who had advanced to the center of the room, and
stood regarding her mystic performance with a sort of awed
wonder, she said in a low, soft voice, that sounded to him
like the murmuring of a distant brooklet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the chief know that the Great Manitou has given
the white maiden a mysterious power, greater than is possessed
by any of the Indian medicine-men? Would Ku-nan-gu-no-nah
like to see evidence of the white maiden&rsquo;s power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian stood quite still while she was speaking, with
a look of mingled doubt and awe on his face. At last he
said in his harsh voice:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! Let Ku-nan-gu-no-nah see what Sun-Hair can
do. She is not a great medicine-woman. There is but one
who has a mighty power from the Great Spirit, and that is
Yon-da-do, the great conjuror of my tribe. Sun-Hair can&rsquo;t
get away. The chief will kill her if she tries. Let Ku-nan-gu-no-nah
see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the chief look and be convinced!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vinnie attached the slippers to the conductors leading from
the battery, and set them side by side on the cabin floor.</p>
<p>Then, taking up her position behind the table, she commenced
to operate the machine slowly at first, then faster,
until the slippers began to skip about, dancing a sort of shuffle,
which caused the Indian&rsquo;s face to take on a look of still
greater wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; she said, turning the little crank faster, causing the
magic slippers to jump higher and oftener than before.
&ldquo;Do you longer doubt my power? You, Ku-nan-gu-no-nah,
strong brave though you are, can not hold those dancing
moccasins when I command them to move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief&rsquo;s face lighted up in an instant with a look of
scorn and contempt. No one had ever doubted his strength
before. Surely he could hold those skipping bits of leather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let Sun-Hair see the chief hold them
so fast they can not tremble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped down and raised them from the floor, holding
one in each hand.</p>
<p>He clutched them firmly, and then went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See the chief hold them. A pappoose could do it.
See&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were cut short suddenly, the slippers dropped
from his hands, and with a wild shriek of terror, he ran to
the further side of the room.</p>
<p>He stood motionless several minutes, his dusky face the
picture of blank amazement, looking at the palms of his
hands as if he would see what had acted upon them with such
powerful effect. He could not conceal his chagrin as Vinnie
said, tauntingly;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ku-nan-gu-no-nah is a great brave. He is very strong.
He can not hold a pair of moccasins. They jump out of his
hands, and he runs away like a whipped dog! The big
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
chief is very strong. What a warrior he must
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a lie!&rdquo; yelled the Indian, almost beside himself with
rage and mortification. &ldquo;I <i>can</i> hold the dancing moccasins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; said the beautiful magician, sententiously. Ku-nan-gu-no-nah
advanced timidly, and took the slippers up
daintily between his thumbs and fore-fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a firm hold,&rdquo; said Vinnie. &ldquo;You will need all of
your boasted strength. Ku-nan-gu-no-nah, a great chief and
a brave warrior, has said that a pappoose could hold the
dancing moccasins. Let us see if he can do what a pappoose
could do. He says that Sun-Hair has no mysterious power,
more terrible than that of the Indian medicine-man, Yon-da-do.
He will see. Is he ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The savage gripped the magic slippers with all his strength,
seeming determined that this time he would give the fair conjuror
no opportunity to taunt him with lack of success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; he grunted, &ldquo;Ku-nan-gu-no-nah is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have them fast now, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vinnie could not repress a smile as he answered, clutching
the electric slippers tighter than before:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; they not stir now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She muttered a few words in a low tone, passing her hands
backward and forward before her face, and commanded the
slippers to dance.</p>
<p>At the same instant she set the battery in action, and the
chief&rsquo;s hands, acted upon by the electricity, which she had
made more powerful than before, seemed to clutch the slippers
like a vise.</p>
<p>A horrible expression of mingled rage and pain crossed
his distorted face, and he gave utterance to a shrill scream of
fear and agony that might have been heard, so loud and resonant
was it, fully a mile away.</p>
<p>At last Vinnie ceased to turn the machine, and Ku-nan-gu-no-nah
reeled back and sunk down in a corner of the cabin
almost exhausted.</p>
<p>His eyes rolled wildly in their sockets, his mouth twitched
nervously, his long, coarse black hair stood half-erect, and he
trembled with an awful, superstitious fear in every fiber of
his being.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does the chief think now of the white maiden&rsquo;s
power?&rdquo; asked Vinnie. &ldquo;What does he think of the little
box and the dancing moccasins? Where now is his vaunted
strength? Can the great brave do what a pappoose can do?
Does he want to try again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; panted Ku-nan-gu-no-nah, with chattering
teeth. &ldquo;Sun-Hair is a great conjuror. She has a power from
the Great Spirit! She has a <i>devil-box</i>, and moccasins such as
are worn where the Long-knives go when they die&mdash;where
there is fire always! Hell, they call it. The white maiden
is a greater conjuror than Yon-da-do. She has a <i>devil-box</i>
and <i>hell-moccasins</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment there were sounds of footfalls outside the
door. The noise came nearer, and there was a sharp, scratching
sound on the door like that produced by some keen-pointed
instrument.</p>
<p>Vinnie felt a terrible fear forcing its way to her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;What if it should be some of
Ku-nan-gu-no-nah&rsquo;s warriors? Would they show me any
mercy after the trick I have played on their chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scratching noise was repeated, louder than before, and
she could see the heavy door tremble. With a white face,
she stood awaiting&mdash;she knew not what!</p>
<p>The Indian still cowered down in the corner, apparently
heedless of what was passing around him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />THE PHANTOM WARRIOR.</h2>
<p>But it was not fated that Clancy Vere should die by the
scalping-knife.</p>
<p>The Indian who had acted as the leader of the party
leaped forward with a sharp cry, and with a quick blow of
his powerful hand, sent the knife flying from the maddened
brave&rsquo;s grasp into the water tossing and roaring twenty feet
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would Bear-Killer do?&rdquo; he said, giving the baffled
savage a sudden push that sent him staggering back against
the tree. &ldquo;Has he forgotten the laws of our nation? Does
he forget that the great chiefs have said that when a number
of warriors take a captive all shall have a share in putting
him to death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bear-Killer was cowed; but he stood with lowering brows,
glowering upon the young hunter with a look of fierce hatred
that made him appear, with his dark face bruised and bleeding,
absolutely diabolical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wy-an-da is right,&rdquo; he said, at length. &ldquo;Bear-Killer forgot.
The pale-face must die hard! Bear-Killer must be
avenged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will give the white hunter to the laughing waters,&rdquo;
said Wy-an-da. &ldquo;He must die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four Indians repeated these three ominous words in a
hoarse chorus, and began to circle slowly around the captive,
brandishing their tomahawks and knives furiously and screaming
the wild scalp-halloo of their tribe.</p>
<p>Several minutes passed thus, Vere standing in the circle
of screeching braves calm and unmoved; then all became
suddenly silent, standing still and dropping their hands by
their sides as if moved by a common impulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the pale-face ready to die?&rdquo; asked Wy-an-da.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have said that I do not fear death!&rdquo; replied the young
hunter, calmly. &ldquo;I am ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last faint ray of hope was extinguished now. He was
bound and helpless&mdash;they could do with him as they would;
and as calmly as possible he resigned himself to his fate&mdash;the
horrible fate that seemed inevitable!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wy-an-da will tell the pale-face hunter how he must
die,&rdquo; said the chief. &ldquo;It is not a pleasant death. He will
be afraid. His heart will grow small within his bosom and
his face will be white as the snow in winter. He will not
like to die so. Will he be brave at the last moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I am ready to die!&rdquo; shouted Vere.</p>
<p>He knew that the savage was trying to torture him, and he
would not let him see what pain it really gave him&mdash;the anticipation
of this sudden and terrible departure from the life
that had just begun to seem so happy to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you wait?&rdquo; he added, stolidly. &ldquo;I tell you I
am ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Wy-an-da. &ldquo;The white hunter is a
brave man. He shall die thus: he will be hung by a lasso,
head downward, from the branch of that tree there that
reaches out over the laughing waters. Then the Indian that
can throw his tomahawk the truest will cut the lasso, and
the white man will fall down and the laughing waters will
sweep him over the rocks. Then his body will be dashed to
pieces on the sharp stones below! Is it pleasant to think
of? Will the pale-face be brave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech was greeted by a chorus of satisfied grunts
from the savages.</p>
<p>A shudder ran through Vere&rsquo;s frame and his spirits sunk
as he heard the chief pronounce his fearful doom; but it was
only for a moment. Then he appeared calm and apparently
unmoved.</p>
<p>A more diabolical torture could not well be conceived.</p>
<p>It was terrible&mdash;this standing face to face with death; but
the young hunter showed no signs of fear.</p>
<p>Five minutes later he was swinging, head downward, over
that black flood hastening on with a wild roar to the precipice
below.</p>
<p>The chill autumn wind, wailing in fitful gusts through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
forest trees, his body gave an oscillating motion, and it seemed,
as he swayed at that dizzy height, as if every vibration would
precipitate him into the water below.</p>
<p>After the lasso was securely fastened to the protruding
branch, the Indians drew back about twenty paces from their
swinging victim and prepared for their trial of skill in hurling
the tomahawk.</p>
<p>Each was anxious to have the first throw.</p>
<p>At length it was decided that Wy-an-da should have the
precedence.</p>
<p>He took his place with a confident air, like one who is assured
of success.</p>
<p>Carefully noting the distance, he drew his tomahawk back,
and, taking deliberate aim, gave it a quick jerk; and it went
whirling out of his hand.</p>
<p>They watched its flight eagerly.</p>
<p>It missed the lasso by six inches.</p>
<p>The swaying hunter was saved thus far.</p>
<p>He had been watching Wy-an-da as he only could look
whose life hung on the issue.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes as he saw the weapon whizzing through
the air, and awaited the end.</p>
<p>A tall Indian of massive frame stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-wan-ton try,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He measured the space accurately with his keen eye; but
his tomahawk flew wide of its mark, burying itself to the
eye in the limb to which the lasso was secured.</p>
<p>The victim of the laughing waters was saved again.</p>
<p>Next came Wolf-Nail.</p>
<p>The young hunter watched him with a white face and a
heart wild with despair.</p>
<p>He stepped forward slowly, and hurled his tomahawk without
much care.</p>
<p>The swinging cord was a difficult target.</p>
<p>Vere felt the lasso jerk, and thought the end had come.</p>
<p>But he was saved again.</p>
<p>The handle of the tomahawk struck the lasso, and the
weapon glanced off and fell with a muffled splash into the
water.</p>
<p>Bear-Killer was the last to try.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>He was yet half-wild with rage; and with the blood still
streaming from his disfigured face, he made ready to hurl his
tomahawk, hoping to sate his vengeance and send the young
hunter to eternity.</p>
<p>Vere was looking at him, and his heart seemed for a moment
to stop its pulsations.</p>
<p>This time death seemed certain.</p>
<p>He saw that the red demon did not intend to throw at the
cord.</p>
<p>He was taking deliberate aim at his head!</p>
<p>The young hunter saw him draw back his weapon, and
closed his eyes.</p>
<p>There was a moment of terrible agony to the man vibrating,
as it were, between earth and eternity&mdash;and then all became
dark!</p>
<p>He seemed to be shooting down&mdash;down&mdash;and he knew no
more.</p>
<p>He had fainted.</p>
<p>Those few terrible moments of suspense&mdash;ages they seemed
to him&mdash;had been more than he could bear. The constantly
tightening noose around his ankles was excruciatingly
painful, and the position in which he hung caused the blood
to flow to his head. None but a man young and strong like
Vere could have retained his consciousness so long as he had
done.</p>
<p>Bear-Killer was exultant. A moment more, and his fiend-like
longing for vengeance would be satisfied.</p>
<p>He noted the distance carefully with his practiced eye, and
with a grim smile of triumph on his blood-streaked face,
raised his tomahawk and prepared to make the fatal throw.</p>
<p>Suddenly a wild, unearthly cry, like a prolonged wail, rung
out on the wind, sounding strangely ghastly above its moanings.</p>
<p>Bear-Killer&rsquo;s tomahawk slipped from his grasp, and a sickly
pallor overspread his face, and those of his companions
blanched to an ashen hue.</p>
<p>The four Indians gave utterance to wild cries of fear and
consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Spirit Warrior! The Spirit Warrior!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>A white steed was flying across a small opening in the forest
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
directly toward them, and mounted upon its bare back,
guiding it with neither bridle nor reins, rode a ghastly human
skeleton of gigantic proportions.</p>
<p>With cries of terror, the stricken little band of savages
turned to fly.</p>
<p>On came the terrible Phantom Rider with the speed of the
wind!</p>
<p>As it drew near, it sprung up suddenly, and standing upright
on the back of its flying steed, threw something round
and black high in the air; then, with another unearthly
scream, rode on and disappeared in the forest.</p>
<p>The thing went up with a hissing noise, a broad, brilliant
streak of flame marking its course, and then fell with a terrific
explosion in the very midst of the Indians.</p>
<p>Then there came a chorus of agonized shrieks, and three
of the savages were laid dead on the ground.</p>
<p>Bear-Killer escaped, and fled with a loud, terrified howl
into the forest.</p>
<p>The dead Indians were horribly mangled, and Wy-an-da&rsquo;s
head was blown a rod from his body.</p>
<p>Then all was silent save the roaring cataract and soughing
wind.</p>
<p>Not a being was in sight, save the unconscious one who
swung by a small cord between this life and the one beyond
the grave!</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />THE MAYBOB TWINS.</h2>
<p>Emmett Darke went into the forest in search of game;
and he was successful, for in an hour&rsquo;s time he had shot and
dressed a large buck.</p>
<p>He only took the choicest portions of the deer, which he
rolled carefully up in the skin, leaving the remainder to the
wolves, panthers, and other beasts of prey that infested the
forest. He bound the pelt around the meat he had selected
by means of deer-skin thongs through a firmly tied loop, in
which he thrust his gun-barrel; and throwing his burden
across his shoulder, set out for home.</p>
<p>He was very anxious to reach the cabin; for he could not
keep his mind from dwelling on his conversation with Vinnie
that afternoon, and he did not like to leave her alone longer
than was necessary.</p>
<p>The blood-hound, Death, who had rendered his master
valuable service in securing the deer, trotted along after him,
as if pleased with the idea of returning to the cabin so soon.</p>
<p>The hunter had proceeded but a short distance, however,
when he met with an accident that nearly cost him his life.</p>
<p>As the afternoon advanced, the chill November wind blew
harder and colder, till its moanings changed to a fierce roar,
and it was evident, even to eyes less accustomed to weather
signs than Darke&rsquo;s, that a fearful storm was approaching&mdash;one
of those cold, gusty rains peculiar to the North-west.</p>
<p>As he was passing a dead oak, whose barkless, decayed
trunk and bare, broken branches bore marks of the storms
and winds of a hundred years, he was startled by a loud
crash overhead.</p>
<p>Looking up, he saw that a fearful gust of wind that just
then swept through the wood, blowing the dried leaves and
twigs hither and thither and everywhere in wild confusion,
had broken off a massive limb, which was falling with lightning
velocity directly toward him. Dropping his burden, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
sprung aside, but though the movement saved his life, he did
not escape the full force of the blow.</p>
<p>The ponderous mass came whirling down, one end of it
striking him on the back of the head.</p>
<p>He reeled and staggered two or three steps, and then sunk
down insensible among the fallen leaves.</p>
<p>After surveying his fallen master a minute or two, the
blood-hound advanced and lay down by his side, as if to
keep guard over him. For several minutes he remained in
this position, then probably not noting any signs of vitality
in the unconscious man, he arose, and, after whining several
times in a low key, the sagacious creature took the sleeve of
his hunting-shirt between his teeth and pulled it gently. This
action was repeated several times; and at last, receiving no
reply from his master, the faithful dog set out as fast as his
feet would carry him for the cabin.</p>
<p>Had he forsaken his master, or gone after assistance?</p>
<p>How long Darke remained unconscious, he knew not.</p>
<p>When consciousness returned, he found himself in a sort
of cavern fitted up as a hunter&rsquo;s lodge, apparently, for great
piles of skins were to be seen in different parts of the place,
and a couple of rifles leaned against the rocky wall at one
side, while a small keg, that evidently contained powder,
stood near by, half concealed by a deer-skin hunting-shirt,
which was thrown carelessly over it, with a bullet-pouch
and powder-horn secured to the belt.</p>
<p>He noticed also that the cave was divided into apartments,
for a curtain made of the skins of various wild animals
was suspended from a cord overhead.</p>
<p>A dull, hard pain in his head caused him to think of himself,
and he now saw, for the first time, that it was bandaged,
and he was reclining on a bed made of the pelts of the bear
and the panther at one side of the place.</p>
<p>If any further evidence was required to satisfy the hunter
that the place was inhabited, it was forthcoming in the shape
of a savory odor of broiling venison that was wafted from
the inner apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was he? Who had brought him to this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These and many other questions he asked himself, but after
five minutes had been consumed in vain conjecture, he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
as far from the solution of the mystery as at the moment
when he first awoke to consciousness. He remembered the
circumstance of the falling limb in the forest, and after that,
all was blank. He did not know when he came, or who had
brought him to this place. He was familiar with the country
for miles around, he thought, and yet he did not know
that there was such a cavern in the vicinity of his cabin.</p>
<p>Of one thing, however, he was assured.</p>
<p>The people who occupied the place must be friendly, else
why had they brought him here and cared for him so tenderly?</p>
<p>Soon he heard a voice in the other part of the cave&mdash;a
coarse, heavy voice, evidently that of a man. It said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us the whis&rsquo;, &rsquo;Lon. I guess he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; round all
correct. A good pull at this&rsquo;ll fetch his idees back, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A corner of the curtain was raised, and a man appeared,
carrying a small bottle of liquor&mdash;so Darke inferred from the
words he had just heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, stranger, how do you feel?&rdquo; said he, approaching
the hunter. &ldquo;I reckon you got a right smart of a swat along
side yer poll with that ar&rsquo; twig out yender. I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if it&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; splintered when it struck <i>terry-firmy</i> if you
hadn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; happened along jest in the nick o&rsquo; time to break its
fall. I was a witness of the lamentationable catastofy, and
see the stick when it broke off; but I obsarved that &rsquo;twas
bound to fall, and knowin&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t stop its wild career, I
let it fall; and then started to go to you, but I had to stop
and watch that ar&rsquo; pup o&rsquo; your&rsquo;n. He&rsquo;s a nation cute plant,
he is, and I reckoned he was a-goin&rsquo; to snake you home; but
after awhile he give up and started off for help. Then I
went out and picked you up and brought you here and laid
you out. Here, take a little pull at the whis&rsquo;. It&rsquo;ll kinder
regulate yer pulse, set yer heart in stidy operation and ile up
yer thinkin&rsquo; merchine. Don&rsquo;t say a word. I ain&rsquo;t ready for
you to talk yet, and, besides, I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve as how you&rsquo;re a
nat&rsquo;ral talker anyhow. Now I&rsquo;m a nat&rsquo;ral-born talker. When
I was an infant and didn&rsquo;t weigh but fourteen pounds, my
uncle Peter informed my ma that he thought I&rsquo;d become a
preacher or an auctioneer with the proper advantages&mdash;and
my uncle Peter was a physionologist and a powerful judge of
live-stock!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Darke took the flask, drank some of its contents, and handed
it back to the man, whom he had been regarding attentively
from head to foot all the while he had been speaking.</p>
<p>He was very tall&mdash;nearer seven feet than six&mdash;and his frame
was massive in proportion. He was, to judge from his face,
which was partially obscured by a thin growth of sandy beard,
thirty-five years of age, though one might easily have called
him five years older or five years younger. He had pale
watery-blue eyes; a capacious mouth, from which projected
the points of a few large, scraggy teeth; very high and sharp
cheek-bones; enormous ears; long, sunken jaws, with hollow
cheeks, and a high, sloping forehead, blowing about which,
and streaming down his back, were a few long, thin locks of
red hair, escaping from beneath the rim of a battered and
dirty old silk hat that had once been white, though evidently
a good while since.</p>
<p>This ancient tile was secured to the giant&rsquo;s great head by
means of a light strap of deer-skin, which was lost to view
under his chin among his sparse, bristling whiskers.</p>
<p>He was dressed in a fur garment, part coat, part pantaloons,
that enveloped his entire person from his chin to his feet,
which were enormously large, and incased in a pair of cowhide
boots that looked, so extensive were they, and at the
same time so old, as if they might have seen service, in the
removal of the baggage of the patriarchal Noah and his sons
and daughters from the family mansion to the ark, when they
were compelled to pull up stakes and emigrate at the time of
the universal deluge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Darke asked after the &ldquo;natural talker&rdquo; had stopped to
take breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, stranger, or Mr. Darke, I might say&mdash;for I&rsquo;ve known
you by sight this four year&mdash;you&rsquo;re right here, and safe, I
reckon. I&rsquo;ve lived here six years, and I&rsquo;ve never seen any
r&rsquo;al ginewine ghosts yet. I&rsquo;m Leander Maybob, formerly of
Maybob Center, down in old Massachusetts. If I was real up
in etiquette, I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; introduced myself afore; but I
ain&rsquo;t polite. Now my uncle Peter was a master polite man.
I remember once, when he went down to Bosting to sell his
wool&mdash;wool was &rsquo;way down that season, he lost on that wool
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
awful&mdash;and got kinder turned &rsquo;round like. Well, he kept
wanderin&rsquo; all over for a right smart of a while, but he couldn&rsquo;t
nohow see his way clear back to the &lsquo;Full Bottle Inn&rsquo;&mdash;he
was a-puttin&rsquo; up there. My uncle Peter was a master polite
man, and didn&rsquo;t consider it proper to speak to folks as
hadn&rsquo;t been introducted to him, and so he kept right on
wanderin&rsquo; about without inquirin&rsquo; the way till late in the
afternoon, when he begun to experience the gnawin&rsquo; pangs of
an empty stummick; and he made up his mind as &rsquo;twould be
better to be guilty of a breach of politeness than to starve.
But he wasn&rsquo;t quite certain, and so he took out his etiquette
book&mdash;he always carried one, my uncle Peter did, Deacon
Checkerfield&rsquo;s, I believe&mdash;and looked to see if there was any
rules touchin&rsquo; this very peculiar case o&rsquo; his&rsquo;n. Well, he set
down on a bar&rsquo;l in a shed, for &rsquo;twas a-rainin&rsquo; hard by this
time, and studied his book till it got so dark he couldn&rsquo;t see
to read any longer, and then he concluded to break etiquette
or bu&rsquo;st. Etiquette was a master fine thing, he argu&rsquo;d, the
very foundation o&rsquo; society; but &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t hardly the thing for
an empty stummick. So he got up and went into a big house
right across the way. Here he see a feller as looked kinder
nat&rsquo;ral. &lsquo;Pardin,&rsquo; sez he, &lsquo;your countenance looks f&rsquo;miliar.&rsquo;
He made a master bow as he spoke. &lsquo;Will you be so kind
as to tell me the way to go to the Full Bottle Inn?&rsquo; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
no way in p&rsquo;tickler&rsquo;, sez the feller. &lsquo;Beg pardon,&rsquo; sez my uncle
Peter. He was a master polite man. &lsquo;But I want to
know how fur &rsquo;tis to the Full Bottle Inn.&rsquo; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no distance
at all,&rsquo; sez the feller, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s right here.&rsquo; My uncle give
in and begged the feller&rsquo;s pardon&mdash;he was a master polite man,
my uncle Peter was. He&rsquo;d been settin&rsquo; right in front of the
inn for hours studyin&rsquo; his etiquette book, cause he didn&rsquo;t know
nobody to ask. He didn&rsquo;t tell of it for five years afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the curtain which divided the cavern was
pushed back at one side, and another person advanced toward
Darke and his Titanic companion.</p>
<p>He came and stood by Leander Maybob, and the hunter
looked from one to the other in astonishment.</p>
<p>He was scarcely four feet in hight, the top of his head
barely reaching the giant&rsquo;s waist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>His apparel resembled that of his more portly companion,
with the exception of the covering for the head and feet.</p>
<p>The dwarf&rsquo;s round little pate was surmounted by a grotesquely
broad-brimmed wool hat, and he appeared, as his
small keen eyes flashed quick, nervous glances about, not unlike
the traditional &ldquo;toad under a cabbage-leaf,&rdquo; while his
lower extremities were adorned by a pair of nicely-fitting
deer-skin moccasins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my little brother,&rdquo; the giant said, by way of introduction.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the Maybob twins. We ain&rsquo;t much
alike you see. He&rsquo;s a little mite of a feller, and I&rsquo;m big
enough to be his daddy; he&rsquo;s dumb&mdash;can&rsquo;t speak a word&mdash;and
I&rsquo;m a nat&rsquo;ral talker. Now uncle Peter said as how he
thought &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t hardly fair, makin&rsquo; me so big and so complete
in every way, and him so little and scarce; but says
daddy, says he&mdash;and he was a univarsal smart man daddy was&mdash;says
he it&rsquo;s all in the family, and they&rsquo;ll both together
make a couple of middlin&rsquo; good-sized men&mdash;they&rsquo;ll about average,
and it&rsquo;s all in the family. My little brother&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s
Alonphilus. But if we&rsquo;re different in sich respects, we&rsquo;re
alike as fur as the one great principle of our lives goes.
Ain&rsquo;t we, &rsquo;Lon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a scintillant glow in the dwarf&rsquo;s little black eyes
as he nodded assent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />OUT IN THE STORM.</h2>
<p>Trembling herself with a fear all the more terrible because
of its vagueness and uncertainty, and with her beautiful
face pale as death, Vinnie stood and watched the trembling
of the heavy cabin door, as the scratching noise was repeated
for a third time.</p>
<p>The sound was louder, more imperative than before.</p>
<p>The chief seemed suddenly to arouse from the state of
frightened inactivity into which he had fallen, and rising on
his feet, walked, or rather staggered, toward the shaking
door.</p>
<p>He seemed to have lost all his strength, for he reeled
across the floor like a drunken man.</p>
<p>For two or three minutes the sound was not repeated, and
Vinnie and the savage stood waiting with bated breath.</p>
<p>They had not long to wait.</p>
<p>Again came that harsh, grating sound, as though some one
was digging the point of a knife, or some other hard, sharp
instrument into the door.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously with this noise, came a long, low
whine, evidently that of a brute.</p>
<p>Vinnie started.</p>
<p>The look of wild fear left her face, and she advanced toward
the door, while the low wail was repeated in a louder
key and more prolonged than before.</p>
<p>She gave utterance to a glad exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <i>Death</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident in a moment that Ku-nan-gu-no-nah, also,
had discovered the cause of the strange sounds.</p>
<p>He seemed to gain new strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the dog!&rdquo; he said harshly, laying hold of the girl&rsquo;s
hand, just as she was about to open the door to admit Death.</p>
<p>Vinnie nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is large and strong,&rdquo; continued the chief, &ldquo;and his
teeth are like the points of knives!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>She knew her power over his untutored, superstitious mind,
and she was no longer afraid.</p>
<p>She nodded again and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is very strong, and his teeth are like needles. If
he sets them into an Indian&rsquo;s flesh he will die. Shall I let
him in to you? His name is Death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The savage gripped her hand tighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, with evident alarm. &ldquo;Sun-Hair must not
let the dog in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giving her a quick, sudden pull, he drew her across the
room and through the other apartment to a rear door.</p>
<p>Her face changed color and she tried to release herself
from his hold, but without avail.</p>
<p>Here he unhanded her, and went back and closed the door
between the two rooms. Barring it securely he returned,
and laying his heavy hand on her shoulder, he bent over till
his dark face almost touched hers, and fairly hissed through
his set teeth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sun-Hair has a mighty power from the great Manitou.
She has escaped Ku-nan-gu-no-nah this time, with her devil-box;
but let her beware! If the dog could get at the chief
he would kill him, but Ku-nan-gu-no-nah is safe. Before
Sun-Hair can open both doors he will be away in the forest.
Let the pale-face medicine-woman beware!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vinnie did not try to detain him. She could not. All
the time he had been speaking, his hard, bony fingers were
closed on her shoulder like an iron vise.</p>
<p>He let go his hold suddenly, and an instant later was running
across the little open space at the rear of the cabin.</p>
<p>Vinnie saw him disappear among the trees, and then turned
and opened the door that led into the other apartment.</p>
<p>In a moment she had undone the fastenings of the other
one, and the blood-hound sprung into the cabin.</p>
<p>He stopped before Vinnie, and looking up into her face,
gave utterance to a long, low whine.</p>
<p>She patted his head and caressed him, but he would not
be satisfied.</p>
<p>Still whining piteously he turned, and with his red eyes
fixed on her face walked toward the door.</p>
<p>She did not heed this mute appeal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>He turned again and going up to her, took hold of her
dress with his teeth and pulled it quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Death, old fellow!&rdquo; she said, caressing the sagacious
brute again. &ldquo;What is the matter? Where is your
master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she mentioned her father the dog pulled harder at
her dress, almost pulling her along toward the door.</p>
<p>A wild fear seemed suddenly to force its way to her heart.
There was only one way in which she could account for the
strange demeanor of the dog.</p>
<p>Surely something must have happened to her father!</p>
<p>She was sure of this when she remembered a story that
he had told her once, about the blood-hound&rsquo;s saving her
life when she was a child of five or six.</p>
<p>The chill wind was blowing harder than when the hunter
set out from the cabin, and the black, angry clouds, hanging
low in the sky, threatened momentarily to open and shower
down the cold, half-frozen November rain over the earth.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while Vinnie looked out, there came a fierce
gust of wind tearing through the great oaks and rattling their
heavy leafless branches against the walls of the cabin.</p>
<p>Twigs and leaves were flying in wild confusion through
the air, and it was growing darker every moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wild and fearful storm is approaching,&rdquo; said the girl,
shudderingly; &ldquo;but I must not hesitate. My father is in
danger&mdash;may be he is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused a breath, as if fearful to say the word; and
then went on: &ldquo;Maybe he is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog was tugging at her dress again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, in reply to his dumb, eager look. &ldquo;Yes,
I am going. Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And shutting the door after her, she followed her brute
guide out into the storm, which had now begun to fall, and
away through the forest till they arrived at the place where
the hunter had met with the accident from the falling limb
a short time before.</p>
<p>Here the dog stopped, and after sniffing about for a moment,
readily found the trail which the giant hunter had
made as he carried Darke away to the cavern, where we left
him at the close of our last chapter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Then he turned, and pulling again at Vinnie&rsquo;s dress, trotted
slowly away on the track he had just discovered.</p>
<p>The storm had been steadily increasing, and it had been
growing darker all the time, till the forest was indescribably
somber and gloomy.</p>
<p>The brave girl did not shrink; but drawing a blanket she
had thrown around her on leaving the cabin closer about her
slender form, to shield her in a measure from the sleet that
dashed against her person, cutting almost like a knife, she
pushed on after the blood-hound, increasing her speed to
keep up with him.</p>
<p>By and by Death stopped suddenly at the foot of a steep,
rocky acclivity.</p>
<p>He seemed, all at once, to have lost the trail.</p>
<p>Vinnie drew her blanket closer about her face and shoulders,
and crouching close up against the trunk of a large tree,
watched him eagerly.</p>
<p>He ran back and forth several times along the base of the
acclivity, searching for the lost trail; then paused at last,
with a quick, glad yelp, before a large rock that, almost hidden
by the thick overhanging shrubbery along the hillside,
seemed to be firmly imbedded in the earth. Then for several
minutes he made no sign.</p>
<p>Had he lost the trail again?</p>
<p>He whined, and began to scratch away at the earth about
the bottom of the bowlder.</p>
<p>Vinnie, at a loss to account for his strange behavior, drew
the blanket up over her head, and creeping closer up under
the friendly shelter of the great tree-trunk, looked on in
wonder.</p>
<p>It did not occur to her that the flat stone might conceal
the entrance to the cavern beyond&mdash;for she was indeed at the
opening that led into the place where Leander Maybob, the
giant hunter, had carried her father but a little while before.</p>
<p>Soon the blood-hound stopped digging, and sat down, with
another long, low whine, keeping his red eyes fixed immovably
on the dark surface of the rock before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it mean?&rdquo; Vinnie asked herself. &ldquo;He does
not search for the trail any longer. Why does he stop here?
What is there about that rock? I wonder if it is immovable.
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Perhaps it covers the trail some way. I am going to
attempt to move it. It looks very ponderous. It must be
very heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She examined the bowlder closely, but could see nothing
to indicate that it had ever been stirred from the place where
it seemed so firmly imbedded into the earth.</p>
<p>She laid hold of a corner that appeared to project more
than any other portion of the rock, and pulled with all her
strength.</p>
<p>The stone remained immovable. Of what avail were her
weak little hands?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can not stir it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is as firmly fixed as
masonry. I am not strong enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the dog saw that she was trying to remove the
bowlder, he recommenced scratching at the dirt at its base,
giving utterance ever and anon to quick, glad yelps.</p>
<p>She tried once more; but her second efforts were as unavailing
as her first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no use,&rdquo; she said, half to herself and half to the
blood-hound. &ldquo;I can not stir it. But what does it mean?
In what manner does it cover the trail? It does, somehow;
or Death would surely pick it up and follow on. What a
fearful storm! I never saw one like it before. How the
sleet cuts my face and hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she shrunk back into her old shelter.</p>
<p>The dog kept his place before the bowlder, from which he
never removed his eyes till his quick ear caught a strange
sound, which even Vinnie heard plainly above the roar of the
storm.</p>
<p>Following the direction of the brute&rsquo;s gaze, the girl saw a
sudden and unexpected sight.</p>
<p>Some one was approaching on a white horse.</p>
<p>She cowered down out of sight behind the tree-trunk and
watched. The storm half blinded her; but she could see
that it was a man, and that something, wrapped in a thick,
black cloth, hung limp and helpless across the horse before
him. It was like a human being. Was it alive or dead?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />OVER THE PRECIPICE!</h2>
<p>The minutes&mdash;ten&mdash;thirty&mdash;sixty, dragged slowly by, and
Clancy Vere knew naught of them. All this time he had
hung by a cord between this life and the next; but he comprehended
it not. He was still insensible.</p>
<p>The wind increased in force until it swayed the great tree
from which he was suspended, and swung him backward and
forward, pendulum-like, over the turbid, roaring flood below.</p>
<p>Still he knew it not.</p>
<p>By and by a lithe, dark form, with great fiery eyes and
ravenous jaws drew its dark length out of the cover of a
thicket near by, and creeping stealthily along the ground, ascended
the tree, and crouched menacingly on a branch directly
above him.</p>
<p>It was a panther.</p>
<p>For ten minutes the terrible brute eyed him with its red,
fiery eyes, and then, settling further back on its haunches,
prepared to pounce upon him.</p>
<p>Still he knew not his peril!</p>
<p>Closer down on the branch of the tree crouched the panther,
its great red eyes seeming fairly to blaze, while its long
tail waved to and fro, lashing first one of its sleek, shining
sides and then the other.</p>
<p>It was all ready to spring&mdash;in an instant it would dart
from its perch on the limb and shoot like an arrow down
upon its swaying prey; every muscle of its lithe body was
contracted. One breath&mdash;and then?</p>
<p>There was a dull, cutting sound, as a tense-drawn bow-string
was jerked straight, and a long, slender arrow came
whizzing out of a copse near at hand, and, pierced to the
heart, the panther rolled off of the limb and fell quivering
to the ground at the very moment when its victim seemed so
secure and its triumph so complete. Its powerful limbs
straightened out, and the ravenous brute was dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>In a moment a form emerged stealthily from the thicket
and crept across the opening to the foot of the tree.</p>
<p>It was Bear-Killer!</p>
<p>His ugly face still bled from the effects of the kick he had
received from the young hunter a couple of hours before.
His purpose in returning so soon to the scene of his late discomfiture
and the death of his companions, is easily surmised
when the reader remembers that he was as vindictive and
vengeful as a fiend.</p>
<p>He gave the panther a kick with the toe of his moccasin,
and saw at once that it was quite dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The panther would cheat the red-man out of his revenge,&rdquo;
he said, savagely. &ldquo;It must not be so. Nothing can save
him now. He must die! The revenge of Bear-Killer is near
at hand. The white hunter&rsquo;s time has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Indian ceased speaking, he drew his tomahawk, and
stepped back a few paces where his aim at the head of the
swinging and senseless young hunter would be true and certain.</p>
<p>He noted the distance accurately with his practiced eye,
and poised his weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How quick he will die!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;How easy
Bear-Killer will slay him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear-Killer will not slay him!&rdquo; said a deep voice, close
at his side; and a heavy hand was laid on his arm, so suddenly
and with such force that the tomahawk fell from his
grasp and half buried itself among the leaves at his feet.</p>
<p>Bear-Killer turned with a sharp grunt of rage and surprise.
His mutilated face expressed nothing, but his small, baleful
eyes scintillated like those of a cowed and baffled wolf.</p>
<p>The hand on his arm tightened its hold, and the deep,
stern voice repeated authoritatively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear-Killer will not slay him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was an Indian, tall and massive in build, and
manifestly the superior of Bear-Killer in strength.</p>
<p>His dress and equipments indicated him to be a chief.
Bear Killer seemed to recognize his superiority, either of
rank or strength, or both.</p>
<p>It was Ku-nan-gu-no-nah, who had but just now made his
escape from the cabin of Emmett Darke, and the terrible
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
power which he believed Vinnie possessed; and he was making
his way back through the forest toward the Indian village,
when he discovered Bear-Killer in the act of consummating
his dreadful vengeance on the unconscious white
man.</p>
<p>Ku-nan-gu-no-nah recognized this white man at a glance.</p>
<p>He knew it was Clancy Vere.</p>
<p>And he had particular reasons for not wishing Bear-Killer
to become his slayer.</p>
<p>Perhaps his chief reason was that he wanted to put the
young hunter to death himself.</p>
<p>He was aware that Clancy Vere was his successful rival
in the affections of Vinnie Darke, or Sun-Hair, as he was
wont to call her.</p>
<p>Jealous and vindictive as he was, this was sufficient to
make him hunt his pale-faced rival to the ends of the earth,
if he could not compass his death without.</p>
<p>Many times when he had seen Clancy go to the hunter&rsquo;s
cabin, had he vowed in his fierce, jealous rage to kill him,
but something had heretofore always intervened to baffle
him; but now he was exultant. The time for which he had
so long waited had come. The young hunter was bound
and insensible in his power. He asked nothing more. His
triumph seemed almost complete. His discomfitures and rebuffs
at Vinnie&rsquo;s hands that afternoon had more than ever
determined him to wreak vengeance on her lover, since he
stood in too wholesome awe of the lovely magician to think
for a moment of again attempting to obtain forcible possession
of her person&mdash;at least not at present.</p>
<p>With a sudden movement, Bear-Killer wrenched himself
free from the chief&rsquo;s grasp, and faced him half angrily, at
the same time picking up the tomahawk out of the leaves at
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does the chief interfere?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Ku-nan-gu-no-nah, &ldquo;he would slay the
pale-face hunter himself. He has cause for revenge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has not Bear-Killer cause for revenge?&rdquo; the Indian
almost yelled. &ldquo;Look at his face! Yonder white man did
this. The pain is like a thousand tortures. What says the
chief? Has he greater cause for revenge than Bear-Killer?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;The chief has greater cause for revenge than Bear-Killer,&rdquo;
said Ku-nan-gu-no-nah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not!&rdquo; said the Indian, decisively. &ldquo;Bear-Killer
will not be cheated out his vengeance! He saved the pale-face
from the panther that he might kill him himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the chief has saved him from the vengeance of Bear-Killer
that <i>he</i> might have <i>his</i> revenge!&rdquo; said Ku-nan-gu-no-nah,
with a grim, devilish smile. &ldquo;Let the warrior wait, and
he shall see the vengeance of a chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He advanced toward the tree; and, as he neared it, his
gaze fell on the dead and horribly mangled bodies of the
savages who had fallen before the terrible charge of the Phantom
Rider.</p>
<p>The undergrowth had concealed them from his view until
now.</p>
<p>He started back with a loud cry of surprise and wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he do it?&rdquo; he asked, pointing toward the swaying
white man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bear-Killer, in a voice that was half a gasp.
&ldquo;No; it was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then?&rdquo; interrogated the chief, in an awed whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Spirit Warrior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Spirit Warrior!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief reiterated the words in a dazed sort of way, like
one under some subtle spell, while for an instant a shudder
seemed to convulse his massive frame, causing it to shake like
an aspen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bear-Killer, &ldquo;it was the Spirit Warrior&mdash;the
spirit of the outcast chief, Meno. When will Meno&rsquo;s vengeance
be complete?&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Ku-nan-gu-no-nah and all his braves are no
more! When the sons of the red-men who tortured their
own chief to death are all numbered with the dead! Then,
and not before, will the vengeance of the outcast and murdered
sachem, Meno, be complete. Every day brings it nearer
the end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Indians started as though a keen-edged knife had
pierced their vitals. Then they stood transfixed with fear,
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
staring into each other&rsquo;s eyes as if to inquire the source of
the answer that had come to Bear-Killer&rsquo;s question almost
before it had left his lips.</p>
<p>The tones of the voice that had spoken the words were
hollow, and the weird and terrible menace seemed to be borne
to them on the winds from afar off, in a wild, ghastly chant
that thrilled every fiber of their superstitious beings with a
vague horror that they could not shake off.</p>
<p>The dismal wailing of the wind through the forest trees,
the sullen roar of the storm which had set in a little while
before, and the monotonous dashing of the cataract below, all
combined to inspire them with a sort of awed dread, that the
spirit voice, crying out to them above the crash of the wind
and storm, augmented into a wild, ungovernable fear.</p>
<p>For several moments, the two Indians stood silent and motionless,
neither daring to speak or stir.</p>
<p>For a few seconds the wind was hushed and the dashing
storm seemed to have spent its fury.</p>
<p>Then in an instant it seemed as if the storm demon had
sent forth all his forces of wind and sleet. Trees were
blown over, limbs were flying hither and thither, and the
wind increased to a perfect tornado, wailing and shrieking
like a regiment of fiends. The Indians saw that the white
man was swinging to and fro at a fearful rate. It seemed as
though the lasso must break at every oscillation. He vibrated
backward through a space of fully twenty feet. They
could not keep their footing, and were obliged to throw themselves
prostrate on the ground.</p>
<p>High above the fearful roar, and crashing of uprooted trees
and fallen limbs, loud and clear above the shrieking of the
wind, was borne to them again the voice of Meno, the Spirit
Warrior:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Ku-nan-gu-no-nah beware! Meno&rsquo;s vengeance will
overtake him. He will die a more horrible death than even
his devilish mind can comprehend! Let him beware!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Indians remained motionless upon the earth,
trembling at every joint. Although giant trees were being
uprooted on every hand and massive limbs were falling
all around them, they were unharmed.</p>
<p>Clancy Vere&rsquo;s peril was imminent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The tree, from a branch of which he was suspended, groaned
and cracked under the force of the storm, threatening momentarily
to break loose from its place in the bank and go
crashing over the precipice.</p>
<p>Even if the stout roots remained firm in their hold on the
earth, the cord by which he hung was liable to be jerked
asunder at any oscillation of his body; and he would shoot
headlong down into the seething flood underneath and be
swept to destruction over the waterfall below.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour passed, during which the two savages
did not arise from their recumbent position and the
spirit voice did not again speak.</p>
<p>The tree remained firm and the lasso seemed to deride all
attempts on the part of the tempest to break it. It would
crack, but it would not part.</p>
<p>Thus far, Clancy Vere had been saved; but he was still
unconscious, and had not realized the terrible danger that
had menaced him.</p>
<p>Soon the storm began to abate somewhat.</p>
<p>Ku-nan-gu-no-nah and Bear-Killer got upon their feet by-and-by,
when the fury of the storm was in a measure spent.</p>
<p>Their sharp sense of bearing had been keenly alert to
catch any further words from the Spirit Warrior. But they
did not hear the terrible, menacing voice again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has gone,&rdquo; said the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Bear-Killer, in a tone of relief. &ldquo;We
shall hear it no more to-day. It went away on the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vengeance of Meno is terrible!&rdquo; said the chief,
with a shudder. &ldquo;But we are safe now. Now for my revenge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Bear-Killer. &ldquo;We will draw lots. I, too
have come here for vengeance on the white hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief grunted a guttural and very unwilling compliance
to this proposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hurry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or he will be dead. He is
almost dead now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bear-Killer made a very small mark on the trunk of the
tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one that throws his tomahawk the nearest to the
mark wins,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>They took their places almost on the verge of the high
bluff on which they were standing.</p>
<p>Ku-nan-gu-no-nah threw first.</p>
<p>His tomahawk buried itself in the tree-trunk, within half
an inch of the mark.</p>
<p>There was a baleful glow in Bear-Killer&rsquo;s wolfish eyes as
he poised his weapon, a treacherous glitter that the chief did
not fail to notice. Just as the handle of the tomahawk was
slipping out of his grasp, the chief dealt him a powerful blow
on the side of the head. He staggered a moment and his
body swayed to and fro as he tried to regain his balance on
the very edge of the bank. The next instant his wild death-yell
came up from below!</p>

<br />THE GIANT&rsquo;S STORY.</h2>
<p>Darke noted the angry flash in the dwarf&rsquo;s little black
eyes, as he nodded an eager assent to his brother&rsquo;s strange
question, and wondered not a little what the &ldquo;one great purpose&rdquo;
of this queerly assorted pair&rsquo;s lives was; but he forbore
to question the giant, not doubting that, if it was not some
secret that they did not wish to disclose, he would explain
himself in good time. And this belief was not far from correct,
as the giant hunter&rsquo;s next words attested. He sat down
on a stool near at hand; and as Alonphilus came and stood
at his side, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; wer&rsquo;e livin&rsquo; for some purpose. We have given our
lives up to revenge! Wer&rsquo;e a-gittin&rsquo; revenge every day,
hain&rsquo;t we, &rsquo;Lon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarf&rsquo;s round little pate was bent forward again until
Darke just caught the glitter of the dusky eye under the broad
rim of his slouch hat; and this he interpreted to be a token
of assent to the giant&rsquo;s question. As his face was raised to
view again, he thought he saw the dwarf&rsquo;s mute lips move,
as if in an attempt to speak, and he imagined that volumes of
vindictive, vengeful words were struggling for utterance.
But the dumb tongue was incapable of expressing even a tithe
of the dark passion that was written on every lineament of
the pigmy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve anuff to be revenged for, God knows!&rdquo; Leander
Maybob went on. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t never wipe out of our
memories our old father and mother that the red devils murdered
in cool blood; we can&rsquo;t never forgit the awful sight
our eyes rested onto, when we came home from a hunt one
morning; we can&rsquo;t never wipe this out of our minds. But,
the just God helpin&rsquo; us, we&rsquo;ll wipe every one of their murderers
off o&rsquo; the earth before we die! The devil that led them
shall die a more horrible death than even his own hellish
mind has planned for his poor helpless victims! We&rsquo;ve done
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
a deal t&rsquo;ward fulfillin&rsquo; our vow in the past six years; eh,
&rsquo;Lon? We&rsquo;ve made many a savage bite the dust in that
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarf&rsquo;s hand darted into the bosom of his hairy vestment;
it came out again in an instant, and he held up to
Darke&rsquo;s view a deer-skin string about four feet in length,
which was knotted almost from one end to the other.</p>
<p>He touched each knot in succession with the forefinger of
his right hand, accompanying every motion with a nod of the
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just a hundred an&rsquo; forty-eight knots,&rdquo; said the big
hunter; &ldquo;and every one on &rsquo;em is a red-skin&rsquo;s eppytoph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That slender strip of deer-skin, simple and harmless as it
appeared, told a ghastly story of conflict and of death and of
half-sated vengeance!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll git our hands on him yet,&rdquo; the big hunter went on.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had chances to kill him of&rsquo;en enough; but jest a
common death ain&rsquo;t enough fer him. He desarves more; an&rsquo;
I want to give him his jest desarts. He must die an awful
death! Our vengeance&rsquo;ll overhaul him yet, &rsquo;Lon. Then
you may tie a double knot! We&rsquo;ll give him two varses to
his eppytoph; eh, &rsquo;Lon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarf nodded, touched the hilt of his hunting-knife
significantly, and made motions as if to tie a knot in the string
which he still held in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of whom do you speak?&rdquo; queried Darke, as he supported
himself on his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red fiend that led the attack on our cabin! The
devil that shot my mother and carried my old father&rsquo;s white
scalp away in his belt! Hain&rsquo;t we got reason plenty fer vengeance?
Do ye wonder that we hunt, and kill Indians as
you would kill serpints? Do ye think it&rsquo;s strange that we
don&rsquo;t want to let that red imp die a common way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big hunter had arisen while he spoke, drawing his
Titanic form up to its full hight. The expression on his face
was terrible to look upon. As he finished, he brought his
ponderous clenched fist down, striking it in the horny palm
of his other hand.</p>
<p>Drake half shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;<i>no</i>!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;No death&mdash;no torture on earth is
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
horrible enough to be meet punishment for the atrocities of
such a fiend incarnate! Is he an Indian chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant nodded. His ungovernable rage seemed to have
entirely spent itself, and he did not speak; but stood with
folded arms and downcast eyes, his massive frame as motionless
as though carved out of the solid rock around
them.</p>
<p>Alonphilus seemed to partake keenly of this feeling of
undying, inveterate hatred of the Indians. His face wore a
hard, implacable look, and he kept drawing the record of
their vengeance slowly through his fingers from one hand to
the other, as if he longed to tie the short end of it that was
yet unmarked by the little death register into one great hard
knot, that could never be entangled, in commemoration of
the passage from this life to the next of the murderer of his
parents and the triumphant consummation of their terrible
work of vengeance.</p>
<p>The spell that was on the big hunter was only momentary,
and it was but a minute or two before he was himself again;
and he signified his willingness to resume the conversation
by saying, as he reseated himself on the stool at the side of
the couch of skins on which Darke reclined:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I heerd Elder Fugwoller say onc&rsquo;t&mdash;and he was
college l&rsquo;arnt&mdash;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a long tow-path, or cow-path, or suthin&rsquo;,
as hasn&rsquo;t got no turns into &rsquo;em;&rsquo; and I believe it&rsquo;s true as
gospil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarf turned and walked across the cavern, and,
pushing aside the dividing curtain, disappeared within the
inner apartment, replacing the death record in his bosom as
he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day of retribution is sure to come at last. It is not
often that the guilty escape punishment,&rdquo; said Darke. &ldquo;It
is sure to overtake them sooner or later. God&rsquo;s justice is
certain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; returned Leander Maybob, &ldquo;as how Ku-nan-gu-no-nah&rsquo;s
tow path or cow-path&rsquo;ll take a mighty unexpected
turn some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ku-nan-gu-no-nah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big hunter seemed surprised at Darke&rsquo;s sudden exclamation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the devil&rsquo;s name. Do you know
him? Have <i>you</i> got an account ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Darke, sitting bolt upright on the couch,
while a hard, stern look settled on his face. &ldquo;Yes; I believe
I have. And I am going to present it for settlement
the very first time I see him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; the other asked, evincing no small
degree of interest in the words and actions of Darke. &ldquo;Has
he ever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; interrupted Darke. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll understand
how it is. We&mdash;I mean Vinnie, my motherless daughter,
and myself&mdash;live alone in our little cabin. There is no
one to keep us company and no one that I can leave with
her when, as I am often compelled to do, I go in search of
game out into the woods. Sometimes I am absent a whole
day together; but I never stay away over night. Some
time last summer, while Vinnie was wandering through the
edge of wood that skirts our little clearing, Ku-nan-gu-no-nah
saw her and conceived the idea of making her his wife. Always
choosing times when I was away, he has several times
come to my cabin; trying to persuade Vinnie to go with
him to his wigwam and become his squaw. He has never
offered her violence, but the last time, failing to induce her
to do as he wished, he threatened to abduct her and bear her
away to the Indian village. I have left her a pistol to be
used as a protector, and she has not been brought up on the
frontier without learning how to handle it. I am staying
away to-day, I fear, longer than I ought to. I hope I shall
be able to go home soon. How long is it since you brought
me here? I begin to feel stronger, as if I could walk easily
enough now. Have I been here long, did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lugged ye in here som&rsquo;eres about the middle of the
a&rsquo;ternoon,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s purty near night now.
&rsquo;Lon&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; back with the glims now. You&rsquo;ve b&rsquo;en here
som&rsquo;ere&rsquo;s about three or four hours. D&rsquo;ye b&rsquo;lieve yer fit to
travel now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Darke. &ldquo;I think all my strength has come
back. I do not feel weak or faint; but my head aches terribly&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all. I must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarf entered at this juncture, bearing four or five
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
pitch-pine torches, which he lighted and stuck into niches in
the rocky walls of the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose ye calkilate to shoot him?&rdquo; said Leander Maybob,
eagerly. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose ye&rsquo;ll kill him. &rsquo;Twould only jest be
in the natur&rsquo; of things fer ye to do so; but I wish ye
wouldn&rsquo;t. I wish ye wouldn&rsquo;t harm a hair of his head. Ye
see he can&rsquo;t die only onc&rsquo;t; and if you kill him he won&rsquo;t
suffer only one death. If we wipe him out, he&rsquo;ll hev to die
a hundred deaths in one! If ye jest load a gun in the common
way and fire it off, that&rsquo;s all there is of it; but if ye puts
in a good many loads and rams &rsquo;em down good till ye&rsquo;ve got
it chuck full cl&rsquo;ar to the muzzle, and then manage some way
to git out of danger and gives the trigger a leetle jerk, why
then ye&rsquo;ll bu&rsquo;st the &rsquo;tarnal thing. Ye see when we tech Ku-nan-gu-no-nah
off, we calkilates to bu&rsquo;st him. I wish ye&rsquo;d jest
let us pay it all off together&mdash;your score and our own. What
d&rsquo;ye say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know a man always feels better for taking his own
revenge,&rdquo; said Darke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know &rsquo;tis,&rdquo; replied the big hunter. &ldquo;I know &rsquo;tis,
and I wouldn&rsquo;t nohow let any man take our job outen our
hands; but when I tell ye our story, I b&rsquo;lieve ye&rsquo;ll agree as
we&rsquo;re the ones that ought to have the prime chance at Ku-nan-gu-no-nah.
If I&rsquo;ll tell it to ye, ye&rsquo;ll jest give the subjick
a few minutes thort, won&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like very much to hear your story,&rdquo; said Darke;
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll consider what you have proposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is unnecessary that we should follow Leander Maybob
through the somewhat tedious length of recital, during which
he made many pauses and numerous repetitions; but we will
give the reader the substance of his sad story.</p>
<p>The giant hunter had, with his dwarf brother and his
parents, considerably advanced in life, come from the East
seven years before, and erected a pioneer&rsquo;s cabin at a
place down the river twenty or twenty-five miles from their
cavern lodge. They commenced making a little clearing,
and for several months all went well; although the Indians
made almost daily visits to their forest home, they never molested
any thing or offered any violence. The days went by
and they began to fancy themselves secure from any harm
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
from the savages. But they put too much faith in their
treacherous natures. When Darke heard how a band of the
dusky fiends, led by Ku-nan-gu-no-nah, attacked the old settler&rsquo;s
cabin one dark, stormy night in the absence of his sons&mdash;when
he heard how the stout-hearted, gray-haired old man
and his feeble wife had been driven out, after defending their
cabin and their lives gallantly for nearly two hours, by the
flames which were devouring their little log home, whose
rough walls had warded off the Indians&rsquo; bullets, which had
rallied harmlessly from their sides; how they had been
butchered as they came out from the roaring, crackling
mass&mdash;when the giant avenger told him with a moisture suffusing
his eyes of the return next morning of himself and
Alonphilus and the heart-sickening sight they beheld; when
he heard all this, he could not wonder that these strange
brothers had taken a solemn and fearful vow to avenge their
parents&rsquo; death. He knew that their claim on the life of the
chief was greater than his; so he said, as he arose from the
couch&mdash;for he was much stronger now:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will promise you this. Unless I find it absolutely necessary
to protect myself or mine, I will try to forego my
revenge on Ku-nan-gu-no-nah and leave him to your disposal.
Is this satisfactory? I believe you have a better right to
kill him than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye!&rdquo; said the big hunter, grasping Darke&rsquo;s hand
and squeezing it almost painfully in his bony fingers.
&ldquo;Thank ye, Mr. Darke. It seems as how I can&rsquo;t thank ye
enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the thanks,&rdquo; said Darke. &ldquo;I am your
debtor. You took me in when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! that&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; interrupted Leander. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he ceased speaking, he turned and led the way into the
inner apartment of the cavern.</p>
<p>Darke felt quite well now, with the exception of an acute
pain in his head, and he followed his strange entertainer with
no difficulty whatever.</p>
<p>The place where he now found himself resembled the outer
cavern a good deal, only it was much smaller and contained
a sort of rude fireplace, on the hearth of which a bright fire
was blazing merrily, sending showers of sparks up a narrow
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
fissure that served as an outlet for the smoke; in short, it
was a natural chimney, and could not have answered its purpose
better had it been built up of stone and mortar in the
usual way. Another small apartment was curtained off from
this in the same manner that the two larger apartments of
the cavern were separated from each other, only the curtain
of pelts was closely drawn, as if special pains had been taken
to shut out the interior from the view of any one in the other
part of the cave.</p>
<p>The big hunter motioned Darke to a seat on the stool near
the fire, and then, followed by the dwarf, passed into this
smaller room, if such it might be called, carefully closing the
curtain behind him. Soon Darke heard him say something
in a subdued tone that he could not understand. A moment
later he caught a few words that caused him to wonder
greatly. Evidently there was a mystery connected with the
little apartment. He heard the rough voice of the big hunter
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he show any signs of life yet? Can&rsquo;t be he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment they returned, but the giant offered no
explanation of the mystery, whatever it was, and Darke
thought best to act as though he had not overheard the
strange words quoted above. A large oaken chest stood
nearly in the center of the place; and on its lid Alonphilus
had arranged a savory supper of broiled venison.</p>
<p>The brothers each drew a stool up by the side of this
strange table, and Leander invited Darke cordially to do the
same.</p>
<p>After he had partaken of the food so hospitably proffered
by his new-found friends, he announced his intention to depart
at once for home. The big hunter told him that it was
already growing dark outside, and he knew that he must have
been away from Vinnie at least five hours, now; and he
feared that she would grow uneasy if he did not return soon.</p>
<p>He thanked the twin avengers for their kindness and was
about to go, when he saw Alonphilus raise one end of the
chest as if to carry it to some other part of the cavern. He
stood close at hand, and he laid hold of the other handle to
assist the dwarf in its removal.</p>
<p>They had gone but a few paces, however, when Alonphilus
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
tripped and fell, dropping his part of the burden to the
ground; and the sudden jar caused the other handle to slip
from Darke&rsquo;s grasp. The chest overturned, the cover flying
back as it did so, and its contents rolled out at the woodman&rsquo;s
feet with a weird, ghastly rattle as it struck the rocky
floor. Darke, strong, brave man though he was, started back
with a quick, sharp cry of alarm.</p>
<p>White and terrible at his feet, lay <i>a grinning, horrible skeleton
of gigantic proportions</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our secret! Our secret!&rdquo; cried the big hunter, hoarsely.
&ldquo;You hev diskivered our secret!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />LOST IN THE FOREST.</h2>
<p>Still crouching down by the great tree-trunk at the entrance
of the cavern lodge of the Maybob twins, in whose
care her father, of whom the reader recollects she came out
in search, was at that very moment, though she knew it not,
and had no knowledge of the cave itself, Vinnie watched, as
best she might, through the blinding storm, the approach of
the rider of the white horse and his mysterious burden.
Death, desisting for a moment from his persistent pawing of
the earth at the base of the rock that had defied the girl&rsquo;s
weak attempts at removal a few minutes before, came, and
standing close beside her, poked his sharp nose out through
the bushes that grew thick around the foot of the tree, and
watched with his keen eyes the horseman, who was coming
nearer every moment.</p>
<p>She could not see the man&rsquo;s face very distinctly, for he
wore a wide, slouch hat that, when he bent far forward on
his horse, to prevent the sleet from beating into his eyes and
mouth, almost entirely concealed it from view.</p>
<p>But the mysterious burden that he carried before him was
plainly visible, and seemed, perhaps because of its very mystery,
to have a sort of weird fascination for her.</p>
<p>She could not see the object, itself; it was so closely
rolled in and so carefully protected from the driving storm
by the heavy black wrap that entirely enveloped it from head
to foot&mdash;for she had firmly determined that it was a human
form. Only one question remained unsolved in her mind
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it alive or dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she yet pondered on this mystery, and with her eyes
on the horseman, every thing&mdash;the white horse&mdash;its rider&mdash;the
man or woman, or corpse, that he had carried before him&mdash;whatever
it was that was hidden from sight so effectually
within the folds of that <i>pall</i>&mdash;she could not believe it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
any thing else&mdash;while yet she saw him coming toward the
place of her concealment, all vanished from her sight as suddenly
and as surely as though the earth had opened and swallowed
them up.</p>
<p>She uttered a little cry of consternation. Then she rubbed
her eyes and looked again.</p>
<p>But there was nothing there, where the man and the horse
and that other <i>thing</i> had been, only the falling storm, still
raging with all its fury.</p>
<p>What could it mean?</p>
<p>She asked herself this question shudderingly, while, in her
fear, she clung around the neck of her great brute companion,
glad in the terror that possessed her of the company which
he, dumb animal though he was, could be to her.</p>
<p>The blood-hound had never, for an instant, removed his
gaze from the place where the mysterious horseman, with his
black burden, had so unaccountably disappeared a few moments
before; and while Vinnie&rsquo;s arms were yet around his
neck he tore himself from her embrace and darted out of
sight among the shrubbery that grew dense and heavy about
the spot.</p>
<p>Vinnie called to him repeatedly, but he did not come back.
She waited, then called again and again with a like result.
The dog did not come; nor could she hear him beating about
the undergrowth.</p>
<p>Had he deserted her?</p>
<p>She would not believe it; and she cried again, her voice
almost losing itself in the roar of the storm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death! Death! Death, come back! Here, Death&mdash;good
old fellow! Come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she waited and listened.</p>
<p>The wind and storm were all the sounds she heard.</p>
<p>Then it seemed to come to her all at once that she was
alone. Even her brute protector had deserted her.</p>
<p>All alone in the tempest that was raging through the forest
like a thousand furies!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone!&rdquo; she quavered, hugging the tree-trunk
closer, as a gust of wind wilder than any before swept
through the forest, uprooting a large sycamore not far away,
and blowing the covering off from her head; letting the sleet
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
dash in its sharp, cutting way into her face. &ldquo;He is gone,&rdquo;
she repeated with slow iteration, &ldquo;and I am all alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of returning to the cabin; but she dared not
face the storm. It was almost certain death to attempt to
make her way home with the storm at its hight and while
trees were falling almost constantly, and branches flying hither
and thither all the time, crashing through the tree-tops and
whirling in mid-air as though they had been but feathers instead
of massive pieces of wood.</p>
<p>She dared not venture out of her shelter. So she shrunk
back as far as possible and waited. Perhaps the storm would
abate somewhat after a while. She hoped it would; and
this was her one bit of comfort.</p>
<p>In an hour&rsquo;s time the tempest seemed to have spent its
fury. The wild roar of the wind had dwindled to a low,
mournful moaning, and the sleet had ceased to fall; but the
rain fell in a slow, monotonous drizzle that seemed likely to
continue through the night.</p>
<p>The afternoon was now very far advanced, but it lacked
more than an hour of nightfall.</p>
<p>Vinnie arose to her feet now, and walked slowly back, as
nearly as she could find her way, over the trail she had come.
She followed it without much difficulty for a short distance,
but by and by when she lost sight of the indistinct pathway
that led away from the cavern, she was obliged to be guided
solely by her judgment of what direction she ought to take to
reach her father&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>For nearly an hour she kept on, picking her way through
the thick undergrowth, and climbing over fallen trees and
heaps of the <i>debris</i> of the storm which was scattered through
the length and breadth of the forest. It was beginning to
grow dark, and the cold November rain kept falling slowly
and steadily. The sky was overcast with black clouds. Vinnie
felt that she made but slow progress, hasten as she might.
The night, when it came, would be very dark, and she dreaded
lest it might overtake her before she reached home.</p>
<p>With wildly beating heart she pressed on; and soon the
landmarks began to grow familiar to her. She was weary
and almost heartsick; but she began to feel more hopeful.
Things along her way looked more and more as though she
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
had seen them before every minute. Was she nearing the
cabin? She thought so.</p>
<p>She had kept a sharp look-out for the clearing that her
father had made around their forest-home, but she could see
nothing to remind her of it.</p>
<p>She kept on bravely, though, never doubting one minute
that she would catch a glimpse of the cabin through the trees
the next.</p>
<p>The trees on either hand appeared familiar. She was feeling
really hopeful now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there in a few moments, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she said to herself
as cheerily as she could. &ldquo;That old crooked sycamore
there looks like an old acquaintance! The clearing must be
just ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pressed onward quite hopefully now; and, five minutes
later, she found herself&mdash;just where she had started from
an hour before. There was the rock that she had tried in
vain to move, and the great tree behind whose sturdy trunk
she had found a partial shelter from the storm!</p>
<p>She staggered back, clutching at a bush for support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;I am lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sunk down on the wet earth almost despairfully.</p>
<p>Then her old brave spirit reasserted itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a poor miserable little coward I am!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
almost angry with herself. &ldquo;What can I do that is
more likely to get me out of my trouble than to try again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was growing dark very fast now and the cold rain was
falling as slowly and monotonously as ever; but she would
not allow herself to think of either the coming night or the
drizzling rain&mdash;and she set out for home a second time quite
bravely.</p>
<p>It was no desirable task that she had before her, and she
did not look upon her weary walk as a mere pleasure trip, by
any means. Still that bold, hopeful spirit that had borne
her up through her adventures with the chief that afternoon
was with her now; and she was far from being despondent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I try, and keep trying,&rdquo; she mused, as she hurried on,
&ldquo;I may reach home in safety by-and-by; and if I am really
lost and must stay in the forest, I suppose there is very little
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
choice in sleeping-places. So, upon the whole, I think I had
better keep traveling about as long as I can. I will try and
not get faint-hearted again, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In twenty minutes it was dark as Erebus!</p>
<p>Still the girl pressed bravely forward through the night.
She could no longer see with any certainty. Keeping any
specific course was out of the question; and it was with great
difficulty that she kept her feet, at times, among the fallen
trees and tangled undergrowth. But she tried to keep a bold
heart.</p>
<p>Glancing ahead, through the blackness, to a dense thicket
just in advance, she saw something that made her pause in
terror. It was a pair of eyes!</p>
<p>Vinnie stood quite still, too much frightened to stir or
cry out. That pair of fixed, fiery eyes had a sort of weird
fascination for her.</p>
<p>All at once, while she yet looked at them, she felt the
blood leaving her heart, and an awful terror took possession
of her whole being.</p>
<p>The eyes were slowly and unmistakably advancing toward
her!</p>
<p>She tottered back a step or two with a low cry. Just then
there was a loud report near at hand. An unearthly screech,
half-human, rung out on the night-air. The eyes seemed to
shoot up a few feet and then they disappeared.</p>
<p>A man came dashing through the undergrowth, and in a
moment he stood beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vinnie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, little one,&rdquo; Darke said, reassuringly.
&ldquo;It was a panther; but it is dead now. It is a fearful night.
Let us hurry home. When we get there, you must tell me
how you came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand in his and they hastened on through
the night.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />A BAFFLED VENGEANCE.</h2>
<p>Ku-nan-gu-no-nah had not intended to push Bear-Killer
over the bluff. He knew that treachery was one of his strongest
characteristics, and fearful lest in some manner he should
lose his revenge, or rather his chance for revenge, on his white
rival, he watched him narrowly as he made ready to hurl
his tomahawk in the trial of skill he had proposed to determine
which of the two should put the unconscious young
hunter to death; and he detected almost instantly the intention
of Bear-Killer to act in accordance with this his most
prominent trait of character.</p>
<p>He saw that the treacherous brave was poising his tomahawk
to throw, not at the mark on the tree-trunk, but at the
head of their victim!</p>
<p>All the quick, wild passion of his fierce nature was aroused
in an instant.</p>
<p>He was not one to brook treachery.</p>
<p>With a cry of rage, he struck Bear-Killer a sudden powerful
blow with his fist.</p>
<p>The doomed savage lost his balance and toppled over the
precipice.</p>
<p>While yet his wild death yell rung out on the storm, Ku-nan-gu-no-nah
threw himself flat on the ground, and craning
his neck out over the bank, looked down into the foaming
water below.</p>
<p>At first he saw nothing but the jagged rocks and the tossing
flood. Then, a little down-stream, the dusky face of his
victim was visible for an instant amid the eddying waters,
then it sunk from sight forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be carried over the waterfall,&rdquo; said the chief.
&ldquo;He will lodge on the rocks below. I will send the pale-face
after him, and he can take his revenge down there. He
will not dispute my right to the first chance. I will take my
revenge now. He can have his afterward&mdash;all he can get!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>There was no place in the red fiend&rsquo;s heart, for remorse for
any evil deed. He had looked upon the whole affair as a
fortunate accident that had rid him of one who stood in his
way&mdash;nothing more!</p>
<p>He arose from the ground and turned his gaze upon his
hated and senseless rival.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to depict the fierce rage and triumph
that flashed from the chief&rsquo;s eyes, as he regarded his
victim.</p>
<p>Clancy was still swaying slowly backward and forward
over the whirling, roaring waters far below, that seemed to
be filled with hoarse, clamorous voices, crying aloud for his
life.</p>
<p>The motion of his body was more gentle now that the
wind had died down. The lasso no longer jerked and cracked,
threatening to break and let him down into the jaws of
death, gaping wide below.</p>
<p>He hung pulseless and heavy, like a man that was dead&mdash;there
was neither a tremor nor a pulsation to tell if he lived
or not.</p>
<p>A hand placed on his heart would have felt the faintest
kind of a flutter; that was all!</p>
<p>He was alive, but for how long?</p>
<p>It was impossible for Ku-nan-gu-no-nah to touch him from
the bank.</p>
<p>He was uncertain whether he was yet alive.</p>
<p>But if he clove his head with his tomahawk, he would be
sure that he was dead.</p>
<p>Was he going to wreak vengeance for a fancied wrong,
on his vital, breathing rival, or on his soulless body?</p>
<p>He did not know. He knew that the soul would leave
the body before his vengeance was accomplished! If the
form swaying before him was alive now he would leave it
dead.</p>
<p>Was he going to tomahawk a man or a corpse?</p>
<p>He did not know, and he did not care!</p>
<p>With an expression of fiendish exultation on his dark, evil
face, he took a position not more than twenty feet distant
from Vere, and drew his tomahawk.</p>
<p>Long practice had made him an adept in the use of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
favorite weapon, and he poised it instantly, without any apparent
care. He was sure of his aim at such close range,
and in a second the tomahawk went whirling out of his hand.</p>
<p>But it missed its human mark by six inches, and fell with
a dull splash into the water.</p>
<p>The wind and the swinging motion of the young hunter
had baffled him!</p>
<p>He uttered a deep curse, and drew a small pistol from his
belt.</p>
<p>To cock it and bring the sights to a level with his eye was
but the work of a moment. He pulled the trigger. There
was a click as the hammer came down&mdash;that was all.</p>
<p>It was not loaded!</p>
<p>Clancy Vere remained unharmed.</p>
<p>The hand of Providence was in it!</p>
<p>With a low cry of baffled rage, he set about loading the
pistol. He had accomplished it in a minute. Would any
thing baffle him now?</p>
<p>He cocked it, put on a cap, and took careful aim at Clancy&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>There was a flash and a sharp report.</p>
<p>He ran to the edge of the bank and examined his intended
victim&rsquo;s face critically; and there was nothing to indicate
that the shot had been effective. Surely it had not touched
his face, and there was nothing that looked like a bullet-hole
in any part of the young hunter&rsquo;s deer-skin clothing.</p>
<p>Ku-nan-gu-no-nah was almost frantic with impotent rage.</p>
<p>In his ungovernable passion, before, at being twice baffled,
he had neglected to put a ball in the pistol!</p>
<p>This explained why he had, as he thought, although he
had taken accurate aim, missed his mark.</p>
<p>Ku-nan-gu-no-nah was a great warrior in his tribe. When
he went on the war-path he always returned laden with scalps
and other ghastly trophies of rapine and murder. Besides
this he was looked upon as the best shot among all the braves
who acknowledged his authority as chief and leader.</p>
<p>Now he seemed to have lost his skill, and his rage and
chagrin were unbounded.</p>
<p>With a snarl like that of a caged tiger, he threw the pistol
over the bluff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it will go down to Bear-Killer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good
enough for him! He won&rsquo;t do much fine shooting now, I
guess! Maybe he will have his revenge on the pale-face
with it. I&rsquo;m going to cut the lasso and send him down, too,
now. I think Sun-Hair, the squaw magician, has saved him
to-day with her devil-box, some way. I&rsquo;ll cut the lasso, and
see if she can keep him from falling into the water! A tomahawk
won&rsquo;t kill him, and a pistol is just as powerless to do
him harm!&rdquo; As he ceased speaking, he drew his hunting-knife
and ran his finger along its edge.</p>
<p>The result of the examination was apparently satisfactory&mdash;the
blade was sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she can hold him up in the air after the
lasso is cut,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Replacing the hunting-knife in his belt, he advanced to
the root of the tree, and began climbing up its trunk.</p>
<p>In two or three minutes he had gained the limb to which
the end of the lasso was secured.</p>
<p>Crawling slowly along it&mdash;for it was not large, and the
waters pitching and tossing underneath made his head swim
just a trifle&mdash;he worked his way out to the place where the
lasso was tied. How the water roared and rung in his ears!</p>
<p>He swung himself astride of the limb, clutching it with
his left hand to make his position more secure, while with
his right he disengaged his knife and dropped its keen edge
on the lasso where it was passed several times around the
projecting branch.</p>
<p>Just then a sudden gust of wind swept past, causing the
tree to sway a little.</p>
<p>Quick as thought he placed the end of the horn handle of
his knife between his teeth and with both hands clung to the
branch on which he sat. It swung from side to side two or
three times, and the chief reeled for a moment as if he had
lost his balance, he gripped the branch with the energy of
desperation, his sharp nails sinking into the rough bark, and
his swarthy face turned to an ashen hue.</p>
<p>In a minute or two the branch became motionless and he
was once more securely seated, with one hand clinging to the
limb and one foot twisted in the lasso in such a manner that
he could disengage it at the instant of cutting the knot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>His situation was a perilous one, but his mind was so intent
on the hellish work he was braving so much to accomplish
that he heeded it not.</p>
<p>The least motion of the tree&mdash;a sudden gust of wind&mdash;a
false movement on his part&mdash;the merest trifle would bring
upon him the death he had planned for the man swinging below,
who, until the lasso should be severed, was more secure
than he. Again he clutched the keen-edged hunting-knife,
and was about to draw it across the coils of the lariat.</p>
<p>A strange sound arrested his attention.</p>
<p>It was the voice of a man.</p>
<p>Steadying himself in his seat, he turned his head.</p>
<p>He beheld a sight so startling that he almost loosened his
grip on the limb. The knife slipped from his grasp and he
held on with both hands.</p>
<p>A white man stood on the bank not ten yards distant, with
a rifle leveled at his head.</p>
<p>He was a very tall and very massive man, of very grotesque
appearance; and when the reader is told that it was Leander
Maybob, the giant hunter, and no one else, a personal description
is unnecessary. The muzzle of his rifle pointed steadily
at the Indian&rsquo;s head, and he said in a rough tone of command
that the chief was afraid to disobey, and, at the same time
fearful to obey:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ku-nan-gu-no-nah realized that the time occupied in the
passage of a bullet from the big hunter&rsquo;s unerring rifle to his
brain would be very short.</p>
<p>He attempted to hitch backward along the limb and came
near losing his hold and shooting down into the roaring water
below.</p>
<p>He looked at the giant in a half despairful way, which he
only noticed by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down, or I&rsquo;ll shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he essayed to move himself backward along the
limb. It was a perilous undertaking, but death stared him
grimly in the face, let him look whichever way he would.</p>
<p>Once more. This time he swayed so far to one side that
it was with the greatest difficulty that he regained his equipoise
on top of the branch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Now he turned his gaze for an instant again to the man
on the bank who held his rifle in his hands&mdash;the man whose
father and mother he had murdered, though he knew it not.</p>
<p>If he had known the terrible oath of vengeance that the
giant hunter had registered against him, he would have chosen
to strangle in the stream underneath rather than to fall
into his hands.</p>
<p>He paused a moment, shuddering as he half lost his hold
on the limb.</p>
<p>Again that stern command rung in his ears:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His efforts at moving along the branch toward the body of
the tree were attended with better success, now that the limb
began to grow larger and his seat more secure. Still his progress
was very slow. He could have moved forward easily
enough, but he dared not turn around.</p>
<p>When he paused to take breath a moment, he heard the
big hunter say in his implacable voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! D&rsquo;ye want ter be shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He exerted himself to the utmost, and five minutes later
slid down the trunk of the tree and stood doggedly before
his captor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ku-nan-gu-no-nah is a great chief, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; the giant
said, tauntingly. &ldquo;He climbs trees and can&rsquo;t get down ag&rsquo;in
without help. Ain&rsquo;t ye glad I happened along ter help
ye down? He is a mighty warrior! He goes with twenty
or thirty of his greasy braves in the night to kill and scalp
a white-haired old man and a decrepit old woman! Some
time I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; ter wipe ye out, ye cowardly red divil! but
not now. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; ter let yer live a little longer, and then
when I git ready to kill ye, you&rsquo;ll suffer as many awful deaths
as all of your victims put together! Yer can go, now. I&rsquo;m
done with yer for the present. Come, don&rsquo;t stand there!
Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew his rifle to his face and kept it aimed at the Indian&rsquo;s
head till he had gone out of sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />A WELCOME VISITOR.</h2>
<p>Hand in hand Vinnie and her father hurried on through
the storm and darkness. The way was intricate and difficult
to travel; but a good half-hour&rsquo;s walk brought them to the
edge of the clearing, and the weary girl greeted the sight of
the cabin, which looked like a large square patch of blackness,
through the gloom, with feelings of grateful satisfaction.</p>
<p>It was the work of but a few moments for Darke, while
Vinnie lighted a candle, to rekindle the fire that had burned
out during their absence. The girl set the light on the table,
and almost exhausted with the vicissitudes of the past few
hours, threw herself upon a seat. The fire was now crackling
merrily on the hearth, sending showers of sparks up the
wide chimney, and Darke, divesting himself of his hunting-shirt
and belt, stood before its genial blaze to dry the water
that adhered to his deer-skin apparel. When he took off his
wide-rimmed hat and, after shaking off the rain, tossed it
into a corner, Vinnie noticed for the first time that his head
was bandaged about with a white cloth. The hat had concealed
it before, and he had not spoken of it, or asked her
any questions as they came home; his mind being filled with
the mystery of the oaken chest and its horrible contents and
the strange words of the giant hunter in regard to his discovery
of their &ldquo;secret.&rdquo; He had made no reply to these words.
He could make none except to regret the accident that had
brought to his notice any thing that the twin avengers did
not wish him to see; and thanking them again for the kindness
they had extended to him, he came away.</p>
<p>Vinnie arose and coming over to where he was standing
put her hand on his arm, saying, anxiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are hurt, papa! I knew something had happened
to you, or Death would never have acted so strangely. Tell
me about it, won&rsquo;t you? Does it pain you much? What
can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, little one. It is well enough now. The pain
is very slight, and it is well cared for already. I don&rsquo;t think
of any thing that would make it any better. But where is
the dog? I don&rsquo;t see him here. I know he came here after
I was hurt. Did he go out with you into the forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied with a smile. &ldquo;Or I went with him,
rather. I would not have gone if it had not been for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it, child,&rdquo; said the woodman, eagerly.
Then noticing for the first time, the electric machine on the
table which Vinnie had left open just as she had used it that
afternoon, and the magic slippers still attached to the battery
and lying on the floor near by, he went on. &ldquo;Have you been
taking a private shock or enjoying an electric jig all by yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, coolly enough, as though it was the
most trivial of incidents she was speaking of, instead of a
struggle for more than life with a bloodthirsty savage. &ldquo;I
have not been electrizing myself; but Ku-nan-gu-no-nah
called here this afternoon while you were gone and I guess I
shocked him considerably. He seemed to be not a little affected
by the experiments of which he was the subject. I
think he entertains quite an exalted idea of my attainments
as an electrician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, girl?&rdquo; he asked, excitedly, placing a
hand on either shoulder and looking down into her face in a
curious, half-startled way. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you. Has
that bloody-hearted devil been here to-day? Explain yourself!
Tell me what you mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seating herself before the fire, while her father listened
eagerly, interrupting her often with exclamations of surprise
and anger, she told him the story of the afternoon&rsquo;s adventures
from the time of his departure from the cabin to the
moment when he came to her deliverance in the forest as
she recoiled in terror before the approach of that pair of lurid
eyes, not omitting the mysterious disappearance of the white
horse and its rider, and the limp, helpless burden that, rolled
in the pall-like cloth, he carried before him across his saddle,
and her subsequent unaccountable desertion by the blood-hound.</p>
<p>Darke was convinced from her description of the place,
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
that she had witnessed this strange scene somewhere in the
vicinity of the twin avengers&rsquo; cavern lodge; and he recalled
to mind the words that he had overheard the big hunter
speak in the small, closely-curtained apartment of the cave.</p>
<p>He seemed to hear them again, so vividly were they impressed
on his mind:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he show any signs of life yet? Can&rsquo;t be he&rsquo;s
dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was there any connection between these unexplained words
and the mystery of the white horse and its rider? Were
they in any way identified?</p>
<p>Darke thought so.</p>
<p>He stood leaning against the rude mantelpiece over the
fireplace for several minutes, his mind busy with conjectures.
But no satisfactory explanation came to the relief of his mystified
mind; and the mystery of the oaken chest, the secret
of the Maybob twins, the strange words of the giant hunter,
and the disappearing horse and man, persisted in remaining
as deep a mystery as ever.</p>
<p>Vinnie, who was naturally anxious to learn the particulars
of her father&rsquo;s accident and subsequent protracted absence
and fortunate though unlooked-for appearance in the forest
at the very moment when he could be instrumental in saving
her life, had been regarding him attentively for a while,
waiting for him to speak and not wishing to break in on his
musings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; he said, at last, looking up suddenly. &ldquo;What
can have become of the dog? I never knew him to behave
so before! It must be that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a slight noise at the door. He listened
intently; and a moment later the blood-hound&rsquo;s well-known
appeal for admittance greeted his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Death!&rdquo; said Vinnie, hastening to open the door.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment he sprung into the room, shaking the
water in a little shower from his dripping coat, and leaping
gladly against his master, who returned his tokens of regard
with a pat on the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deserve a good whipping, you ungallant fellow,&rdquo;
Vinnie said, half in earnest and half playfully, &ldquo;for running
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
off and leaving me to get lost in the woods!&rdquo; The dog paid
little heed to her rebuke, and she continued, addressing her
father: &ldquo;Maybe if Death could only talk, he would have a
story to tell, too. Perhaps he has discovered the mystery of
the disappearing horseman! But you have not told your
story yet. I am very anxious to hear about your accident,
and every thing else that has happened to you since you went
away. You&rsquo;ll tell me all about it now, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she unclosed his lips with a kiss; and he began at
the beginning, and related his adventures to her, leaving out
only that portion which bore directly on the mysterious secret
of which the big hunter had spoken. He had blundered
into a partial knowledge of the private affairs of his newly-found
friends and entertainers, and his rigid ideas of honor
forbade him to make so questionable a return for their disinterested
hospitality as the disclosure of their privacy even to
Vinnie, whom he would not have hesitated to intrust with
the keeping of a life-and-death secret, had it been his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been an eventful afternoon to us both,&rdquo; said Vinnie,
after she had heard him through, &ldquo;and as far as I am concerned,
I do not know that I am very much the worse for
my share of its trials. If you are not severely injured, I
think we may thank our stars for having escaped as well as
we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; replied her father. &ldquo;But, my child, you
look upon the perils through which you have passed too
lightly. It is no trivial matter. I shudder when I think
of what might have been the ending of either of your adventures.
I believe, of the two, the ravenous, half-famished
panther and that fiend incarnate, Ku-nan-gu-no-nah, the latter
was much more to be dreaded. To the ferocity and blood-thirstiness
of the beast of prey, is added the treachery and
vindictiveness of a devil, and the reasoning powers of the
human mind; and, in his hellishness and subtlety, the chief
falls but little short of Lucifer himself! Do you realize what
you have escaped, Vinnie? What should I have done, little
one, if I had lost you to-day? And, Vinnie, there is another
who, I am sure, would find life very void and destitute of
joy did he not dream that some day you might consent to
share it with him. I allude to Clancy Vere. He is a true
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
man in every sense of the word, and I know of no one to
whose loving care I would rather resign you than his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no need to ask her if Clancy Vere&rsquo;s suit would be
successful. He could read it in her blushes.</p>
<p>It was growing late now, and as they were somewhat rested,
Vinnie set about the preparation of the evening meal, singing
in a low voice, and building rosy air-castles as she worked,
while her father busied himself with cleaning and reloading
his trusty rifle, of which he felt justly proud; for a truer or
more unerring weapon was not to be found for many a long
mile, travel which way soever one might.</p>
<p>After they had partaken of the supper which Vinnie&rsquo;s deft
hands had spread neatly upon the table in an incredibly short
space of time, Darke fastened the cabin doors and windows
securely for the night. As he barred the rear door he noticed
that it was even darker than when they came home, and the
chill rain was falling yet in a slow, persistent drizzle. The
wind had died down.</p>
<p>The next morning the storm had ceased, but the sky was
overcast, and every thing as far as the eye could reach bore
witness to the fury of the tempest of the night before.</p>
<p>Nothing unusual transpired at the cabin during the day;
and its inmates seemed very little worse for having endured
the vicissitudes of the previous afternoon. Vinnie had got
up in the morning completely refreshed by her night&rsquo;s sleep,
and the pain was entirely gone from her father&rsquo;s head, leaving
nothing to remind him of the injury it had sustained but
a slight bruise on his temple that would go away in a day or
two.</p>
<p>Toward the middle of the afternoon, as they were seated
cosily by their fire of hickory wood, recounting little incidents
of their adventures that had escaped them the night
before, they were startled by a loud rap on the cabin door.
Darke hastened to open it, and was no less surprised than
gratified to meet Clancy Vere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, boy!&rdquo; he exclaimed, giving the youth a handshake
and a greeting smile in which there was no conventionality,
and which was as heartily returned by Clancy,
whose eye wandered over the old man&rsquo;s shoulder in quest of
Vinnie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The vivid blush that mantled cheek and brow, as her eyes
met his, in no way deteriorated from the prettiness of her
face, Clancy thought; and when she stepped forward half-shyly
and put her trembling little hand in his for a moment,
I think he may be pardoned for allowing his heart to look
out of his eyes and wishing, as he choked back words that
struggled for utterance now harder than they had ever done
before, that just a little while his old friend Darke was in
China, or Jericho, or anywhere but there, witnessing and, in
his quiet way, enjoying the young people&rsquo;s happy confusion.
I am sure any of my readers who may ever have been placed
in a similar situation will exonerate him from all blame.</p>
<p>The young hunter looked pale and worn, and Darke noticed
that when he came forward to take the seat Vinnie had
placed for him before the fire he walked with considerable
difficulty.</p>
<p>In reply to the woodman&rsquo;s inquiries in regard to his jaded
appearance and the manifest trouble he experienced in walking,
Clancy told the story of his capture by the Indians the
day before very substantially as it has already been told the
reader in the preceding pages of our story.</p>
<p>It is not necessary that we should weary the reader with a
recapitulation of what has already been stated; but taking up
Clancy&rsquo;s narrative at the point where consciousness returned,
we will follow it to its close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my senses came back,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I found myself
reclining on a couch of skins and blankets in what appeared
to be a very small apartment of a cave. I was watched over
by a dwarf, who was not much more than four feet high and
as dumb as a door nail. This diminutive watcher strengthened
me by a liberal use of spirits, and as soon as I was able
to speak, summoned his giant brother, who, unlike himself,
was gifted with a ready tongue and introduced himself to me
as Leander Maybob, of Maybob Center down in old Massachusetts.
He said he was a &lsquo;natural talker,&rsquo; and proceeded
to substantiate the statement by a very wordy account of the
sayings and doings of his uncle Peter and an old Massachusetts
minister named Tugwoller, interspersed with snatches of
an old love affair between Elder Tugwoller&rsquo;s niece, Sally
Niver, and himself. It seems that the young couple, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
were, of a verity, true lovers, were separated for life in consequence
of a ludicrous blunder on the part of my giant host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After awhile I gathered from his voluble flow of words that
he had rescued me from my perilous situation and brought
me to his cavern lodge. When I had sufficiently recovered
from the effects of my swing, I partook of some strengthening
food that my new-found friends prepared for me. That was
early this morning. As the day advanced, I found myself
rapidly gaining strength; and an hour or more ago I felt myself
strong enough to come on here, and, thanking my strange
entertainers for their kindness, I took my departure. As I
passed out through the cavern I saw that it was also divided
into two larger apartments, one of which was used as a sort
of home by the two strangely contrasted twin brothers, and
the other was fitted up as a kind of store-room for trophies of
the chase, for it was well supplied with arms and ammunition,
while the skins and pelts of various animals were deposited
in piles about the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much the latter part of Clancy&rsquo;s story is like yours!&rdquo;
exclaimed Vinnie to Darke when he had finished. &ldquo;He was
rescued by the same strange person and taken to the same
place and nursed back to life in the same manner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Darke, &ldquo;it is a singular coincidence.&rdquo;
Then turning quickly toward the young hunter he said, &ldquo;You
must have lain insensible in the smallest part of the place
while I was there&mdash;I think you did. They did not tell you
that I had been there before you came away, did they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Clancy, who had been wondering all along at
the strange words of the woodman, &ldquo;they did not tell
any thing of the kind. I never knew it till now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;And although I am sure
I was there for quite a length of time while you lay unconscious
in the little place curtained off at the back end of the
cavern, the giant did not tell me of your presence. It can
not be that there was any cause for this concealment; and
concealment does not seem to be a predominant trait of the
big hunter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; said Vere wonderingly. &ldquo;Do
you mean to say that we were both at the cave at the same
time? Please explain yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>And Darke told Clancy the story of his accident the day
before, and how Leander Maybob had carried him to the cavern
lodge of his brother Alonphilus and himself, cared for
him till he was able to come home, carefully guarding against
any allusion to the oaken chest and its ghastly contents, but
telling him of the strange episode of the little apartment, and
repeating the mysterious words of the giant hunter, whose
meaning he had until now vainly tried to discover. They
held no hidden portent now. He knew instinctively that the
words he had so vainly wondered at, &ldquo;Does he show any
signs of life yet? Can&rsquo;t be he is dead!&rdquo; referred to Clancy
Vere.</p>
<p>One mystery was solved!</p>
<p>For several minutes both men remained silent. Darke was
ruminating over the discovery he had just made and Clancy
was thinking what a lovely picture Vinnie made as she leaned
carelessly against the mantle, looking intently into the dancing
blaze of the fire, whose red glow lit up her fair face till
it seemed fairly radiant in its fresh young beauty.</p>
<p>Was she building air-castles again?</p>
<p>Clancy was!</p>
<p>Raising her long lashes suddenly, she met his ardent, passionate,
yet respectful gaze.</p>
<p>Both pair of eyes sought the floor simultaneously; and it
would have been no easy task for one to have determined
which face flushed the deepest&mdash;the maiden&rsquo;s or her lover&rsquo;s;
for Clancy Vere knew he did love Vinnie Darke with all his
heart.</p>
<p>Darke had not noticed this little by-play, and he asked, suddenly,
as the pretty air-castles both had been rearing up vanished
as air castles are wont to do when they are rudely jarred:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you think you were at the cavern before
your consciousness returned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not quite certain&mdash;two or three hours I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was Leander Maybob that rescued you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but he did not himself carry me to the cave. It
was more than a mile away that he found me; and although
he is very strong, he could not lug me on his back all that
distance. When consciousness returned he told me about it.
Alonphilus the dwarf conveyed me to the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Darke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Leander told me all about that, too. I was brought
on a horse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What color was the horse?&rdquo; interrupted Vinnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a white horse!&rdquo; pursued the woodman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were rolled up from head to foot in a heavy black
cloth, were you not?&rdquo; Darke went on, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Clancy, surprised at so many questions.
&ldquo;But he carried me before him across the saddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father and daughter uttered simultaneous cries of surprise.</p>
<p>Another mystery was solved!</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />THE FOREST ROSE.</h2>
<p>Ku-nan-gu-no-nah walked swiftly away with the deadly
rifle of Leander Maybob, the giant hunter, still leveled at his
head, fairly demoniac with wild and impotent rage. The
workings of his dark face were fearfully suggestive of the denizens
of the bottomless pit.</p>
<p>Had he been armed he would not have left the vicinity
without first attempting the life of the man who had him in his
power and who held his very life at his disposal; but he was
powerless, having no weapons except a short, sharp-pointed
knife which he always carried in addition to his hunting-knife,
and this would be useless, except in a hand-to-hand conflict,
which even in his wild passion he had not the hardihood to
dare.</p>
<p>In an hour&rsquo;s time he came to the boundary of the wilderness
and the broad prairie stretched its level surface before him as
far as he could see. Not a tree or a bush was there visible
in all this vast plain; only the tall grasses, beat down and
tangled by the fearful tempest that had raged through the afternoon.</p>
<p>Turning from the nearly direct course he had been pursuing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
the chief made his way, with long, rapid strides, to the place
where, in the midst of a dense growth of bushes in the center
of which there was a little plat of smooth, grassy ground, destitute
of undergrowth, he had tethered his horse early in the
afternoon. In less time than it takes to tell it, he was mounted
and galloping away over the plain.</p>
<p>In a little while he struck an indistinct, scarcely worn road,
or rather broad track&mdash;one of the emigrant routes of the
North-west. He followed the track for an hour or more and
then making a gradual <i>detour</i> to the left, kept on at a swift
rolling gallop which he never slackened till he reached the
Indian encampment, situated at the foot of a steep, rocky hill
that loomed up through the storm and darkness, in dull relief
against the leaden sky. Throwing himself hastily from his
horse, he stalked rapidly along and entered a wigwam at the
further end of the encampment. An aged Indian sat on a
roll of skins at one side of the place, in an attitude of deep
grief or despondency. He simply glanced up as the chief entered,
then dropping his face again into his hands, sitting silent
and apparently in great agony of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is the Forest Rose to-night?&rdquo; the chief asked, glancing
toward a couch of skins and blankets on the opposite side
of the lodge, on which he could see the form of a female reclining
by the dim fire-light that illuminated the wigwam.
She lay silent and motionless as though life had fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Forest Rose is very ill,&rdquo; replied the old Indian,
mournfully, &ldquo;and she will die! Yon-da-do, the great medicine
man, has said so. He has made use of all his ceremonies
and mystic arts, but he can not save her. The lovely Forest
Rose must die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he ceased speaking he arose, and lighting a small pitch-pine
torch in the fire, went over to the side of the couch.
Throwing aside the covering from her face, he allowed the
light to fall upon it for a moment. It was a beautiful face,
darkly lovely&mdash;the face of an Indian maiden in the first flush
of womanhood. She was rather light for one of her dusky
race, with heavy masses of raven-black hair falling in lovely
confusion about her statuesque face, in whose contour the
hard angularity of the Indian type was not discernible, and
down upon her perfectly-shaped neck, and softly-rounded
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
shoulders. Her long, heavy lashes lay upon her cheeks,
which were very pale, hiding her dark lustrous eyes, which,
when lighted up with health, added not a little to her almost
bewildering beauty. But now the lovely Forest Rose lay like
one dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let my father look up and be happy!&rdquo; said the chief.
&ldquo;Ku-nan-gu-no-nah has seen a medicine-woman to-day, that
can surely bring back life to the Forest Rose. The medicine-woman
that I saw was a mighty conjuror. The Great Spirit
has given her greater power than that of Yon-da-do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this mighty magician?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a pale-face maiden, as beautiful as the Forest Rose,&rdquo;
replied the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would she come?&rdquo; asked the old Indian, while a hopeful
light flashed out of his aged eyes, undimmed by the flight
of time. &ldquo;Would a white medicine-woman come to give life
back to an Indian girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would not come willingly,&rdquo; said the crafty chief,
&ldquo;but she must be brought! If she is not, the Forest Rose will
die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she must be brought!&rdquo; said the old Indian, decisively.
&ldquo;I will call a council of braves in the morning, and a
party shall be sent to bring the white magician. The Forest
Rose must be saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aged Indian was the real chief of the tribe&mdash;that is,
although he was too old to go on the war-path, leaving the
active fighting to the younger and more warlike Ku-nan-gu-no-nah,
he was the real moving spirit, always planning and
ordering all important movements of the band. The languishing
Forest Rose was his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Ku-nan-gu-no-nah, as he went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great medicine-woman will save the Forest Rose, and
again she will sing like the birds in the trees to gladden the
heart of her father, the great chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wild Buffalo, the aged sachem, called a council of braves
early in the morning, and at midday, the subtle Ku-nan-gu-no-nah,
at the head of a dozen picked warriors, was riding
over the prairie in quest of &ldquo;Sun-Hair,&rdquo; the beautiful magician.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br />THE FACE AT THE WINDOW.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;So the mystery of the disappearing horseman is explained
very satisfactorily at last, Vinnie,&rdquo; said Darke, after their
surprise had subsided somewhat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;all but the mystery of his disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;we are still in the dark concerning
that. How could it have been accomplished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not. It vanished before my very eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was doubtless owing to some peculiar turn of the path
he was following, or something of that sort,&rdquo; reasoned the
woodman. &ldquo;A very sudden turn among the dense growth of
shrubbery that is so thick about the place might have concealed
the white horse and his rider from view almost instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think very likely it was owing to that or a similar cause,&rdquo;
returned Vinnie. &ldquo;I suppose we shall have to accept that
explanation till a better one presents itself. It is strange that
I should have allowed myself to be alarmed at so trivial a matter.
I do not think I am superstitious. But that limp, helpless-looking
black thing did appear ghastly through the
storm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be remembered that Clancy had not heard of Vinnie&rsquo;s
adventures and perils of the day before; and he did not
understand the conversation that the others had kept up for
the past few minutes. Noting the questioning look on his
face, the woodman said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is still another story of peril and escape that you
are yet to hear. I believe I will take a short bout in the forest
in search of a turkey; and if I am successful we&rsquo;ll have a
supper fit for the President. Vinnie can tell you the story
while I am gone. Be sure you don&rsquo;t leave out any of the
important points, and don&rsquo;t forget to mention your lover&rsquo;s visit
yesterday. A truthful account of the <i>shocking</i> manner in
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
which you treated him ought to be a caution to sparks! If
I was a young fellow, now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now! stop!&rdquo; said Vinnie, with a vivid blush. &ldquo;I
think you&rsquo;re really too bad! And besides, you are not fit to
go out to-day, after your hurt, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; interrupted Darke, banteringly, examining
the lock of his rifle the while. &ldquo;I am well enough for any
thing now, and I mean to take just this one more hunt while
I&rsquo;ve an opportunity. I dare not leave you here any more
alone, you know, and I&rsquo;m going while I&rsquo;ve got Clancy here
to keep guard over you! So good-by, and don&rsquo;t think of my
coming back for two hours at the very soonest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went up to him for her customary kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, as he bent and pressed his lips to hers.
&ldquo;Good-by, little one. And, Clancy, I want you to see that
no one repeats this operation during my absence. She&rsquo;s all
I&rsquo;ve got, and I leave her in your care. Don&rsquo;t forget the story,
Vinnie!&rdquo; And a moment later he passed out, closely followed
by the blood-hound. Vinnie seized hold of one of the
great brute&rsquo;s long ears, and bending low over him, to hide
her flushed face from Clancy&rsquo;s view, said, playfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Death, don&rsquo;t run away from him as you did from
me yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, while the young hunter thought she was putting
herself to a great deal of useless trouble, considering that the
room was very warm already, she went and busied herself at
the hearth, for what seemed to him a very long time, stirring
the fire and putting on more wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What story does your father mean?&rdquo; he asked, when she
had at last finished. &ldquo;I thought from what you said that
you saw the dwarf when he was carrying me to the cave.
It can not be that you were out in that terrible storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was,&rdquo; said Vinnie, with a smile, &ldquo;and I half think
I was the victim of almost as serious a series of accidents as
yourself. Papa told me to tell you the story, and I suppose
I must obey. Are you sure it will be of interest to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, eagerly. &ldquo;I know it will be of interest
to me. Tell it, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, half shyly at first, Vinnie complied with his request.
He interrupted her many times during her recital, with exclamations
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
of surprise and wonder; and when she had finished,
and sat demurely before him, with her little hands
folded in her lap, and her lovely face sober and thoughtful,
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven be praised for your deliverance! What if you
had not escaped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, I suppose&mdash;&rdquo; she began, surprised at his excited
manner. But he cut short what she would have said,
by saying, vehemently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had not, I would not now account my life worth
as much as a burnt charge of powder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vinnie glanced up at him quickly, but her long lashes
drooped as she met his ardent look.</p>
<p>He arose to his feet, and standing up before her, went on
in rapid, eager tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you, Vinnie Darke, as I can never love another
woman in the whole world! I ask for your love in return.
Can you&mdash;will you give it to me, Vinnie darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat silent a moment&mdash;a moment that seemed interminable
to the anxious young hunter&mdash;with flushed face and
downcast eyes. The next, she was clasped in his strong arms,
and he pressed a tender kiss on her brow, as he said, in a
low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you love me, Vinnie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lovely, golden-brown head bent down until it was pillowed
on his bosom, the red, full lips were pressed half timidly
to his, the deep, loving blue eyes looked trustfully up
into his own, and Clancy knew that she was his till death!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own darling Vinnie!&rdquo; said he, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;yours always!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am afraid if the woodman could have seen the little episode
that was taking place in the cabin then, he would have
thought Clancy just the least bit forgetful of the injunction
he had put upon him when he went away&mdash;of course he
would not willfully ignore it!</p>
<p>There was a slight, almost imperceptible sound outside the
cabin, that escaped the young hunter&rsquo;s usually quick ear, and
a dark face was pressed for an instant against one of the lower
panes of the little window at the side of the door. It was
withdrawn almost as soon as it appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you will be my wife, Vinnie&mdash;mine to love and
cherish always?&rdquo; Clancy went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your father? What will he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think he will oppose us very strongly,&rdquo; she said,
remembering his words to her that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will ask him and see, when he comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again that dark face peered into the room a moment and
then vanished as it had done before.</p>
<p>But so engrossed were they with each other&mdash;their minds
so filled with their new-found happiness&mdash;that they had no
time to think of any thing else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How hard I shall try to be worthy of your priceless love,
and to make your life happy!&rdquo; said the young hunter, as she
released herself from his embrace. As she stood up, her
eyes were turned toward the window.</p>
<p>The face was flattened against the glass again!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful Heaven!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;there is Ku-nan-gu-no-nah!
Oh, Clancy, save me!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br />VINNIE A PRISONER.</h2>
<p>Darke had been gone but a little while from the cabin,
before he was startled by the report of fire-arms, and the
shrill war-whoop of the band of Indians who, under the leadership
of the wily Ku-nan-gu-no-nah, had been sent out to
capture Vinnie and bring her to the relief of the suffering
Forest Rose, who, although they knew it not, was dead, having
dropped quietly and peacefully away soon after they left
the encampment.</p>
<p>These sounds came from the direction of the cabin, and
by a kind of intuitive perception, he knew in an instant what
was taking place there.</p>
<p>He had just discharged his rifle at a fine turkey that the
blood-hound had come upon in a dense thicket; and reloading
it as he ran, he dashed with his utmost speed through
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
the tangled undergrowth and over fallen trees and heaps of
half-decayed brushwood back toward the scene of the conflict,
which still continued, as the sharp, oft-repeated reports of
guns and the appalling screeches of the Indians attested.</p>
<p>The terrible suspense and agony of mind that he suffered
in the few minutes that passed before he reached the edge of
the clearing, it would be impossible to depict. He knew that
the young hunter was as brave as a lion, and would not give
up while life lasted; but he judged from the steady and rapid
fire kept up by the savages that the odds against him were
fearful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he gasped, as he bounded forward, holding
his long rifle ready for use at an instant&rsquo;s warning, &ldquo;the
bloody fiends will butcher them both! If I could only be
there to help them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, as he ceased speaking, the firing, which for two
or three minutes past had been almost incessant, stopped.
There was a moment of awful silence to the listening woodman,
then there came a loud crash.</p>
<p>Darke knew what this was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the devils have forced the door!
Nothing can save them now! Their doom is sealed! Oh,
Vinnie! Vinnie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His agony was terrible.</p>
<p>He had reached the boundary of the clearing. It was rapidly
growing dark now, and he had little fear of discovery.
He paused a moment to reconnoiter. Only two Indians were
visible outside the cabin. He raised his rifle to his face; his
aim was quick and sure; and an instant later one of the
savages threw up his arms, and with an ear-splitting screech
of agony, fell on his face, dead.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously with the report of the woodman&rsquo;s
trusty weapon, another rung out inside the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Vinnie&rsquo;s revolver!&rdquo; muttered Darke as he stepped
quickly out of sight behind a clump of bushes and proceeded
to reload. &ldquo;Thank God she yet lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peering out, he discovered that the remaining Indian had
set fire to the cabin and was skulking around the other side,
probably to get out of range of his unerring rifle.</p>
<p>It was nearly dark now, but the settler fired again, and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
bullet went crashing through the savage&rsquo;s brain, just as he
had almost gained the coveted shelter.</p>
<p>Vinnie&rsquo;s revolver cracked again inside the cabin as Darke
rammed home another load; and he uttered another fervent
&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; as he thought that she had been saved thus
far. At his request, she had placed it upon her person that
morning, and he had reason to think that it was being fired
by her own hands. He could not distinguish the sound of
Clancy&rsquo;s weapon from the Indians&rsquo;; but he knew him well
enough to be certain that he would not yield except with his
life.</p>
<p>The fire was creeping up the side of the cabin, gaining
ground rapidly in the dry timber of which it was constructed.
In a few moments the whole building would be in a light
blaze. An attempt to extinguish the flames would, Darke
saw, be fruitless.</p>
<p>There was no one to oppose his advance across the clearing
since he had slain the two savages left on the outside to
fire the cabin and guard against a surprise by any one from
without, and closely followed by Death, he dashed over the
intervening space to the open door of the cabin.</p>
<p>Looking within he saw, by the light of the fire blazing on
the hearth, that Clancy Vere was engaged in a desperate, hand-to-hand
struggle with three Indians. His back was against
the wall, and with an almost superhuman effort he forced
them back and kept them at bay with his clubbed rifle. Their
guns were not loaded; but the young hunter detected one of
the trio in the act of charging his rifle, while the two others
vainly tried to get at him with their knives, and, quickly
whipping out his six-shooter, one chamber of which held a
leaden bullet that soon proved a quietus to this most dangerous
of his assailants, he discharged it and had only two enemies
to contend with.</p>
<p>The next moment the young hunter&rsquo;s clubbed weapon fell
with deadly force upon the head of one of the Indians, crushing
it like an egg-shell, while at the same instant the other
fell, pierced through the brain by a ball from Darke&rsquo;s unerring
rifle.</p>
<p>Clancy had fought like a tiger, and though he had not
been dangerously wounded, he had not escaped unscathed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
A bullet fired through the window, before the Indians had
forced an entrance through the battered-down door of the
cabin, had grazed his temple, making an ugly though not
dangerous furrow, and carrying away a portion of his ear.
The blood was trickling down his face, and dropping upon
the floor at his feet.</p>
<p>Darke sprung into the room at a single bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vinnie!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Where is Vinnie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; gasped Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone! My God! what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians made her a prisoner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vinnie! My Vinnie a prisoner in the hands of those
devils! And you let them take her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, while an expression of
keen pain swept across his face. &ldquo;I could not help it! I
would gladly have laid down my life to save hers! For a
time we fought them side by side. There are five dead Indians
here on the floor. She killed two of them. Only two
of the chambers of her revolver were loaded; and after they
were emptied I fought them alone, shielding her form with
mine. Then I was set upon from all sides at once, and she
was snatched away from me. I did all I could. She was
<i>my</i> Vinnie, too, Mr. Darke, and I will wrest her from the
power of that red demon or die in the attempt! You do me
injustice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, boy,&rdquo; said the woodman, extending his hand,
which was readily taken by Clancy. &ldquo;I was mad! I did
not mean what I said&mdash;please forget it if you can. If we
can not get her back, I believe I shall go crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we <i>can</i> get her back&mdash;we <i>must</i>!&rdquo; cried the young
hunter. &ldquo;We must get help and follow them and take her
out of their hands or die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many are there in the party?&rdquo; asked Darke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not certain. At the beginning I think there were
about a dozen or fifteen&mdash;I do not know exactly. Five are
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are seven dead!&rdquo; replied Darke. &ldquo;I shot two
outside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there must be a half-dozen, more or less, that have
escaped, taking Vinnie with them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;They have been gone twenty minutes,&rdquo; said the woodman;
&ldquo;and we must act at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can not follow them to-night,&rdquo; said Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night! Why?&rdquo; and Darke evinced disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are mounted. They left their horses at the
edge of the forest. It is scarcely three miles away. Before
we could overtake them they would be miles out on the prairie,
riding at their horses&rsquo; best speed. We can do nothing
alone, and horses are indispensable&mdash;we must have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can we get them?&rdquo; Darke asked, admitting to
himself the truth of Clancy&rsquo;s reasoning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the settlement. We can have every thing ready to-night
and start before daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think we had better get to go with us?&rdquo;
asked Darke. &ldquo;We must have good men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can do no better than to have Pete Wimple
for one,&rdquo; said Clancy. &ldquo;A truer and braver man can not be
found in the North-west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the woodman. &ldquo;And the big hunter for
another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could only get him!&rdquo; exclaimed Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he will go. He hates the Indians with an undying
hatred, and is glad of any opportunity to wreak his terrible
vengeance on them for the cold-blooded butchery of his
aged parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the young hunter, &ldquo;he told me his story.
What a fiend incarnate the chief is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Ku-nan-gu-no-nah. Was he with the party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He led them,&rdquo; said Clancy. &ldquo;I think he instigated the
attack to get possession of Vinnie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth shuddered as he thought what might be her
fate in such hands. How he longed for the morning.</p>
<p>Darke remembered the promise he had made to Leander
Maybob the day before, and wondered if he could restrain
himself from shooting the red demon at sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we will need any one else?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. There will be four of us; and Pete Wimple
and the giant hunter will be a host in themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make all our preparations to-night,&rdquo; said Darke,
&ldquo;so as to be far on our way at daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We must&mdash; What&rsquo;s that? It sounds like fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange sound had arrested his attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> fire!&rdquo; replied Darke. &ldquo;I saw one of the devils fire
the cabin. It must be all in a light blaze before this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was fired before you came in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was set at the rear, and that is the reason you
have not seen or heard it till now. The flames were climbing
the roof as I crossed the clearing. But we must not stay
here. One of us must go to the settlement and the other to the
cavern to-night. Do you think you can walk well enough to
undertake to get to the settlement? Your ankles must
be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and the look on his face confirmed what he said,
&ldquo;I could do any thing&mdash;brave any thing for her! There is
nothing that I would not attempt to save her from pain&mdash;nothing
that I would not dare, to make her happy! Vinnie
is more to me than my life, Mr. Darke! To-day, before
those red devils came to tear her away from me, she promised
to become my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Darke. &ldquo;I could not intrust
her to the protecting love of a better man. If we can
only save her she shall be yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the young man, earnestly. &ldquo;We <i>must</i>
save her from that demon&rsquo;s power! The thought that she is
in his hands is maddening! But we must act. I will go to
the settlement and obtain horses and enlist Pete Wimple in
our cause, while you proceed to the cave to secure the services
of the big hunter. I&rsquo;m sure he will not refuse us his
aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; assented Darke. &ldquo;Where shall be our place of
rendezvous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near the big pine tree at the edge of the forest. We
must be mounted and on our way before daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire had caught in the great oak trees that had been
left close up by the walls of the woodman&rsquo;s home as a partial
protection against wind and storm, and the flames, shooting
heavenward, cast a lurid glow over the dark forest for quite
a distance in every direction.</p>
<p>The two men hastened away, the burning cabin lighting
their way through the wood, Death, the blood-hound keeping
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
close to Darke and manifesting his sense of the calamity that
had overtaken them by giving utterance ever and anon to low,
sorrowful whines.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br />WHAT THE SCOUTS FOUND.</h2>
<p>When the sun rose the next morning&mdash;for the day broke
clear and cloudless with a keen, frosty atmosphere&mdash;its rays
fell on a heap of smoldering ruins, encircled by a dozen
charred trees burnt and blackened to their very tops. This
was all that remained of Emmett Darke&rsquo;s cabin home.</p>
<p>The four men, Darke, Clancy Vere, Leander Maybob, the
giant hunter, and Pete Wimple, a tried and trusty scout and
Indian-fighter, were at the appointed place of rendezvous at
a very early hour, and, well mounted on four fleet, strong
horses that Clancy and the scout had obtained at the settlement,
they were at daybreak dashing over the smooth, level
prairie in pursuit of Ku-nan-gu-no-nah and his party.</p>
<p>For hours they kept on at a rapid, even gallop, which they
neither quickened nor slackened. Clancy and the scout,
riding side by side and keeping a sharp look-out ahead for
any signs of the enemy, while Darke and the giant hunter
were ever on the alert to guard against the approach of any
hostile party from the rear.</p>
<p>None of the four had spoken more than a few words since
they left the big pine, hours before, even Leander Maybob,
usually so loquacious, maintaining a thoughtful and unbroken
silence.</p>
<p>The day continued as it had dawned, clear and sun-shiny,
the pure, bracing air inspiring the little band to more than
common vigilance and alertness, while it added fresh vigor
to their steeds, and they kept on at the same quick, regular
rate of speed until mid-day without meeting with adventure
of any kind.</p>
<p>Then Pete Wimple drew his horse up suddenly, and in
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
obedience to his low-spoken command, the three others reined
in their horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Pete?&rdquo; asked Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for sartin,&rdquo; and the scout, shading his eyes
with his hand, looked long and earnestly across the wide,
grassy plain before them. Following the direction of his gaze,
the others saw dimly in the distance a thin blue cloud of
smoke rising from the surface of the prairie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fire!&rdquo; said Darke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it are!&rdquo; confirmed the big hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be a camp-fire?&rdquo; asked Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said the scout. &ldquo;I think as how it&rsquo;s some-&rsquo;eres
&rsquo;long the line of the emigrant trail. We&rsquo;ll strike it purty
quick&mdash;it&rsquo;s jist ahead thar&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve got to foller it for severil
hours. We&rsquo;ve got to pass that fire, and afore we get too
cluss, I want to know what it means!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It mought be whites, an&rsquo; ag&rsquo;in it mought be reds!&rdquo; said
Leander Maybob, riding to the front and examining the thin,
vapory cloud for a moment or two. &ldquo;It mought be emigrants
takin&rsquo; thar grub and it moughtn&rsquo;t, ye see. Prob&rsquo;ly &rsquo;tis
and prob&rsquo;ly &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t, as my uncle Peter said when Elder Tugwoller
axed him if his youngest-born son war a boy or a gal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others could not restrain a laugh at this; and when
their merriment had subsided Darke asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think is best to be done, Wimple? You
and Leander are learned in every department of prairie life
and warfare, while Clancy and I are the merest novices. We
shall trust ourselves and our enterprise in your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, as it&rsquo;s about grub time, you and me had better
ride ahead and diskiver, if we can, whether there&rsquo;s white men
or Injuns or suthin&rsquo; else around that are smudge, or whether
its jest a muskeeter smoke, while Low-lander, as you calls
him, and the boy busies &rsquo;emselves about gittin&rsquo; suthin&rsquo; for
our appetites ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; our return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with ye thar!&rdquo; said the giant, &ldquo;as Elder Tugwoller
remarked to my daddy when he expressed his opinion as
how donations was a good institution; but my name ain&rsquo;t
Low-lander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo; laughed Darke as he and the scout
rode away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s a good deal in names, I notice,&rdquo; said the big hunter,
half musingly, as he swung his long left leg over his horse&rsquo;s
head and slipped to the ground. &ldquo;I reckon thar&rsquo;s a sight
o&rsquo; valler in names. If &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t for folks bein&rsquo; named so&rsquo;s to
tell &rsquo;em apart, they&rsquo;d git all mixed and twisted up so a feller
couldn&rsquo;t tell w&rsquo;ich from t&rsquo;uther or t&rsquo;uther from w&rsquo;ich! Now
I don&rsquo;t go very strong for seein&rsquo; things git all mixed and twisted
up so&rsquo;s ye can&rsquo;t discrimernate w&rsquo;ich from w&rsquo;ich. If it hadn&rsquo;t
been fer jest sich a durn&rsquo;d mixin&rsquo; and twistin&rsquo; of two different
things together in my head, I&rsquo;d likely now be a married man,
livin&rsquo; as happy as a hornet in yer breecherloons, down to old
Maybob Center in Massachusetts, the Bay State and capital
of Bosting, the hub of the univarsal <i>terry firmy</i>. It&rsquo;s an awful
world we&rsquo;re livin&rsquo; in,&rdquo; he went on, as he tied his horse, as
Clancy had already done, by means of lariats they had
brought with them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awful world! I never know&rsquo;d
a man to go cl&rsquo;ar through it &rsquo;ithout gittin&rsquo; the wind knocked
outen him somehow! It&rsquo;s this mixin&rsquo; an&rsquo; twistin&rsquo; as does it
all! It&rsquo;s that as caused all my misery and pains and heart-longin&rsquo;s,
and sighin&rsquo;s and so forth and so on. I know folks
in gin&rsquo;ral wouldn&rsquo;t go for to take me for a lovyer&mdash;you, now,
youngster, look more like a lovyer than I do; sorter like a
despondin&rsquo; lovyer, more&rsquo;n any thing. But don&rsquo;t ye git down-hearted
now. We&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; to git yer sweetheart back to-day!
I&rsquo;ll tell you how I found out about it,&rdquo; he explained,
noting Clancy&rsquo;s look of surprise, &ldquo;I heerd ye talkin&rsquo; about her
afore ye come to, fairly, yisterday. I didn&rsquo;t mean ter hear
yer, and didn&rsquo;t go fer to pry into any of yer secrets; but I
couldn&rsquo;t help hearin&rsquo; ye say ev&rsquo;ry few minits, &lsquo;Vinnie!&rsquo; &lsquo;Vinnie!&rsquo;
I heerd Darke say his gal&rsquo;s name was that to-day; and
so I put this and that together and know&rsquo;d you was her lovyer.
I&rsquo;ll tell you &rsquo;bout my gal an&rsquo; my love affair, and then
we&rsquo;ll be even. All our trouble come of this mixin&rsquo; an&rsquo; twistin&rsquo;,
as I told you afore. Elder Tugwoller&rsquo;s niece, Sally Niver,
as purty a gal as ever wore caliker&mdash;she used to live along o&rsquo;
the Elder and his wife&mdash;and me got acquainted with each
other to singin&rsquo; school, and afore we know&rsquo;d it we was both on
us purty nigh as deep into love as Lord Lovel and the Lady
Nancy. The Elder didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;prove of the match, and Sally an&rsquo; me
uster spark on the sly. The Elder found it out and licked Sally
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
and forbid her ever to speak to me ag&rsquo;in. She cum right
straight and told me, and said as how the Elder and Miss
Tugwoller would be away Saturday night over to the widder
Mork&rsquo;s and wanted me to come down an&rsquo; see her while they
was gone. I rigged up and went down; and jest as I got
inside the yard I see Sally cummin, down the path to meet
me, and the tears was a-streamin&rsquo; down her face. &lsquo;They ain&rsquo;t
gone, deary!&rsquo; sez she, &lsquo;and if they see you we&rsquo;ll be in an awful
pickle!&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t go away without inquirin&rsquo; what was
the matter. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; sez she, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had to take&mdash;uncle&rsquo;s bin a-givin&rsquo;
me&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;Another lickin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be bound!&rsquo; sez I. &lsquo;Sally,
yer mine, afore Heaven, and I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to trounce that old
cuss within an inch of his life for abusin&rsquo; ye so, if he is the
preacher!&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh dear!&rsquo; sez she. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t understand he&mdash;oh,
what&rsquo;ll you do? Thar he comes now!&rsquo; And sure
enough, I looked up and thar come the Elder down the path
a-makin&rsquo; motions and a-swingin&rsquo; a big hosswhip. I thought
he was a-goin&rsquo; to lick Sally ag&rsquo;in, and she screamed and I
jumped afore her. Jest then the hosswhip cracked round my
legs. &lsquo;Young man,&rsquo; sez the Elder, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve got things kinder
mixed and twisted up, like, in your mind. Your mind&rsquo;s considerably
mixed and twisted. You don&rsquo;t understand as how
I don&rsquo;t want ye here at all, and you&rsquo;ve got mixed and twisted
up about the lickin&rsquo;, like. I hain&rsquo;t bin a-givin&rsquo; my niece a
cowhidin&rsquo;; I jest give her a dose of peppersass for a cold, and
that&rsquo;s what brings the water outen her eyes. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to give
the cowhidin&rsquo; to you!&rsquo; And he axed the blessin&rsquo; and commenced.
The gad played kinder lively for a minit, then I
jerked it outen his hand and throw&rsquo;d it over into the garden,
and sez I, &lsquo;Elder, if you think I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to stand sich
you must be kinder mixed and twisted up, like, in your idees!&rsquo;
Then I knocked him down and kissed Sally good-by and
walked away. I hain&rsquo;t never seen her since. The Elder sent
her away to school and I come West&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the end on&rsquo;t
all. I s&rsquo;pose she&rsquo;s married long ago!&rdquo; he finished, sadly.
&ldquo;She was jest the sort of gal as ketches men! It was all
owin&rsquo; to my mixed and twisted state of mind concernin&rsquo; the
lickin&rsquo; and the peppersass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time they had prepared the noon-day meal, Clancy
saw Darke and Wimple coming back; and in less than ten
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
minutes they threw themselves from their horses a few rods
away, and after tethering them, came up with rapid strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you find?&rdquo; asked Clancy eagerly; &ldquo;any signs
of Vinnie or her captors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found some of the devil&rsquo;s own handiwork!&rdquo; answered
the scout, a dark, fierce look on his usually pleasant face that
the young hunter never saw there before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smoke we saw arises from two burning emigrant
wagons that the Indians have plundered and then set fire to!&rdquo;
said Darke. &ldquo;One man, evidently the guide, lay dead and
scalped, his body, with those of three savages who had been
shot in the affray, half burned up in the fire! The remainder
of the party, which I should judge was not very large, have
either escaped or been made prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Ku-nan-gu-no-nah&rsquo;s work!&rdquo; said Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to settle with him purty soon!&rdquo;
said Leander Maybob, sternly. &ldquo;His time&rsquo;s most up!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br />THE PHANTOM RIDER!</h2>
<p>Five minutes later the little party was on the move again.</p>
<p>About the middle of the afternoon they halted for a moment&rsquo;s
consultation. Darke was not surprised when the scout
informed him that the Indian encampment was not more than
a half-dozen miles distant. He had long been anxious to
reach the village. The suspense was growing to be almost
unendurable to him.</p>
<p>At first, Leander Maybob took little part in the conversation
and bent his gaze anxiously every few minutes upon the
horizon in the direction whence they had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you advise a bold charge through the Indian encampment?&rdquo;
asked Clancy. &ldquo;Do you think we would be likely
to accomplish our object in that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout thought not. The savages might be on the
look-out for some such movement as that, as they would probably
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
expect that an attempt would be made to rescue Vinnie,
in which case they would run great risk of falling into some
trap set for them by the Indians, if they approached the encampment
boldly and in the full glare of the sunlight. Their
party was too small to hazard being taken at so great a disadvantage.
They dared not show themselves openly in the camp
of their enemies. The odds would be too great against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Wimple, emphatically. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t try such
a plan as that. It would be worse than useless! What we
do must be done by stratagem. There&rsquo;s a steep bluff, only
&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t a bluff, neither&mdash;thar ain&rsquo;t no river under it&mdash;jist back
of the Injin camp. This hill&rsquo;s all grown over with low scrub-oak
and other stuff so thick ye can&rsquo;t see a rod any way. If
we could only git up there and hide till arter dark, and then
two or three of us jist step quietly down and release the prisoners,
leaving some one to have the horses ready to mount at
an instant&rsquo;s warnin&rsquo;, I think we could git the gal cl&rsquo;ar without
much blood-lettin&rsquo;, and maybe the other prisoners, whoever
they are. It&rsquo;s the best plan I can think of now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darke agreed with the scout that nothing could be done by
daylight, but he was getting very impatient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the big hunter, &ldquo;as how ye&rsquo;re partly right
in yer calkerlations and mayhap partly wrong. I don&rsquo;t believe
as how us four rushing into the imps&rsquo; nest would do
much good. We&rsquo;d be very likely to git our little lump of
lead, every one on us, and that&rsquo;d be the end on&rsquo;t all; but instid
o&rsquo; climbin&rsquo; the hill, if ye&rsquo;ll jist take the advice of one who
has fit Injins some, and stop in the border of the wood, down
level with the edge of the prairie, and wait and see what happens,
I b&rsquo;lieve we can do suthin&rsquo; as &rsquo;ll amount to suthin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve
knowed some of the best kind of jobs to be did in gittin&rsquo;
away prisoners from the reds, jist by watchin&rsquo; and takin&rsquo; advantage
of accidents and the like. If you&rsquo;ll all do jist as I
say and not git flustered or go to gittin&rsquo; away up there on top
of the hill, I&rsquo;ll promise that every prisoner in the Indian
camp shall be safe before sundown&mdash;yes, in less than two
hours. You don&rsquo;t know what amazin&rsquo; helps accidents is sometimes,
in sich cases as this one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you do it?&rdquo; asked Darke, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by accidents?&rdquo; inquired Pete Wimple.
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye expect&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to happen to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo; exactly,&rdquo; replied the big hunter. &ldquo;A
feller can&rsquo;t most always tell what is goin&rsquo; to take place. But
I&rsquo;m safe in guaranteein&rsquo; thirty or forty of them reds one
of the tallest accidents in a little while&mdash;&rsquo;bout as soon as we
can git to their camp&mdash;they ever had any ijee of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect to kill as many as that?&rdquo; asked Clancy, in
some wonderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I calkerlate as how, if yer a mind to foller my lead, we can
e&rsquo;en a&rsquo;most clean out the nest and git yer gal and the rest of
the prisoners away safe, besides! What do ye say? Shall I
go ahead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried all three with one voice. &ldquo;You shall lead
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you can do what you say!&rdquo; added Darke. &ldquo;But
remember that a mistake on our part might prove fatal to
Vinnie and the others!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There shan&rsquo;t be no balks or mistakes!&rdquo; said the giant, in
a tone of assurance, taking his place at the head of the party.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to leave this emigrant road here and take to the
left a little. An hour&rsquo;s sharp ridin&rsquo; &rsquo;ll bring us to the Injun
camp. Let&rsquo;s be movin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And tightening their reins, the quartette dashed away.</p>
<p>There was a plain trail, left by Ku-nan-gu-no-nah&rsquo;s band,
leading directly to the encampment of the savages. The little
party followed this for a while at a swift gallop, and then in
obedience to a low, tersely-spoken command from their leader,
left it suddenly, and bearing still further to the left, dashed
for a few minutes through the edge of a broad belt of timber
lying along the base of a range of low hills, halting at last
in a chapparal not more than a hundred yards distant from
the Indian village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said Leander Maybob, throwing himself
off his horse. &ldquo;Jist git off yer nags and stretch yerselves a
little, while I take a look outside. Make the most outen your
restin&rsquo;-spell, for I can tell yer that ye won&rsquo;t have long to lay
idle. I&rsquo;m expectin&rsquo; an accident soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with these strange words which the three men were
assured held more meaning than they expressed, the giant
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
strode away and disappeared from view among the shrubbery.
In less than five minutes he came back, and his face
showed that the result of his reconnoissance was satisfactory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be an accident soon,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon?&rdquo; queried the scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside of a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it assist us in any manner?&rdquo; inquired Darke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;ll be the makin&rsquo; of our job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s onsartin,&rdquo; replied the big hunter. &ldquo;Accidents is onsartin
things; but this one &rsquo;ll be sartin to help us if we&rsquo;re
ready to help ourselves. I&rsquo;ve noticed as how the same accident
don&rsquo;t happen twice, any more&rsquo;n a boy takes his fust chaw
of terbacker twice. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t anyways likely this &rsquo;ere accident
we&rsquo;ve been waitin&rsquo; for &rsquo;ll happen more&rsquo;n onc&rsquo;t. So we must
be ready to take advantage of it jest at the right minit! Now
then, how many shots have we got altogether?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a six-shooter and a rifle, both loaded,&rdquo; said the
scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; said Leander, counting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got six,&rdquo; said Clancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen,&rdquo; counted the big hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got two revolvers and a rifle,&rdquo; said the scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-six,&rdquo; said the giant, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got seven more&mdash;thirty-three
in all. If there ain&rsquo;t any of &rsquo;em wasted, we can
shoot jist thirty-three Injuns without stopping to load! Now
git on yer horses and stick yer pistols in yer belts and hold
yer rifles ready for instant use. I want to take one more look-out,
and I&rsquo;ll be with ye in a minit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big hunter&rsquo;s prompt manner and cool, baffling way
of talking had inspired the three men with the utmost
confidence in himself and his power to bring their enterprise
to a successful termination, and they obeyed his orders implicitly.
In a moment they were mounted, their unerring rifles
ready for use at a moment&rsquo;s warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going to dash into the encampment?&rdquo; asked
Clancy, examining the lock of his revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like it,&rdquo; answered the scout, sententiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can the accident be?&rdquo; questioned Darke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a riddle!&rdquo; said Wimple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;And a hard one to guess!&rdquo; added the young hunter.</p>
<p>Just then the giant came running through the chapparal,
and hastily seizing his ride, which he had left standing against
a tree, threw himself upon the back of his horse and rode to
the head of the little band of wondering, anxious men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minit!&rdquo; he half whispered.</p>
<p>There was a moment of dead silence, the four men almost
holding their breath in their suspense.</p>
<p>Then a shriek rung out on the air&mdash;a shriek that was half
a wail, half a curse&mdash;so weird and so unearthly that for a
moment the blood seemed to stand still in the veins of the
three startled men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! What is that?&rdquo; cried Darke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the accident we&rsquo;ve bin waitin&rsquo; for,&rdquo; said the big hunter,
calmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s purty near time for us to take advantage
of it. Git ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment there came from the direction of the Indian
encampment an almost deafening report, followed instantly
by cries of agony and fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s our time!&rdquo; cried the big hunter. &ldquo;Shoot down
every red-skin you see! But don&rsquo;t harm a hair of Ku-nan-gu-no-nah&rsquo;s
head if you can help it! Take him alive!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they cleared the chapparal, they saw a sight for which
even the terrible cry of a moment before had not prepared
them.</p>
<p>It was a gigantic human skeleton, standing upright on the
back of a milk-white horse that moved with more than the
speed of the wind. In the bony, grisly arms of the Phantom
Rider was <i>Vinnie Darke</i>!</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII.</span>
<br />A REUNION OF HEARTS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It is Vinnie!&rdquo; cried Darke, wildly. &ldquo;Oh God, save my
child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the young hunter, in the same
breath. &ldquo;What is that? Oh! my darling! She is lost!
lost!&rdquo; and he reeled in his saddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Easy!&rdquo; said the giant. &ldquo;She is safe, and you shall
both speak with her in a few minutes. It is Meno, the
Spirit Warrior! He never harms the whites&mdash;he is their
friend; and he&rsquo;ll carry the gal to a place of safety. Git yer
rifles ready. When ye see Injuns, fire sure, and don&rsquo;t miss a
shot. After yer rifles are emptied, git out yer pistols and
shoot down ther devils as long as yer have a load left! They
won&rsquo;t show fight much after the accident that&rsquo;s jist happened
to &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later they had left the timber behind, and were
dashing across the little strip of prairie that lay between it
and the encampment, but a few rods distant.</p>
<p>The four unerring rifles rung out almost simultaneously,
and four savages lay dead or dying on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now yer pistols!&rdquo; shouted the giant, plunging his spurs
into his horse&rsquo;s flanks, and drawing and cocking his heavy
Colt&rsquo;s revolver.</p>
<p>On they sped, their firearms keeping up an incessant rattle,
dealing death on all sides.</p>
<p>They charged through the encampment, then, whirling,
came back, separating and shooting down every brave in their
path, as long as they had a load left.</p>
<p>The giant caught sight of Ku-nan-gu-no-nah trying to hide
himself behind one of the lodges, and leaping from his horse,
dragged the cowed and trembling fiend out into the middle
of the encampment, shrieking and howling with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we had a sort of a settlement!&rdquo; said the giant,
grimly. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll look over our accounts now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indians, men, women and children, such as had not
fallen before the terrible Phantom Rider and the subsequent
charge of the four hunters, had sought refuge in the forest
and thick brushwood growing on the summit of the steep,
rocky acclivity at the back of the encampment.</p>
<p>To the credit of our friends, be it said, that they shot down
only the braves. For the most part, the squaws and children
escaped unharmed, but with the exception of Ku-nan-gu-no-nah
and a half-dozen others, every warrior was slain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the whites?&rdquo; the giant asked the chief, with his
long, bony fingers choking out the answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder, in the council-house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Following the direction of the chief&rsquo;s eye, they saw a log
building, the only one in the encampment, about twenty yards
distant. It had the appearance of being very strongly put
up, and had evidently been built with a view to use as a
council-house.</p>
<p>Darke and the scout hastened to liberate the captives,
while Clancy, attracted thither by the loud snarls and yelps
proceeding from the interior, went and looked over the top
of a small stockade, or rather pen, about ten feet square,
standing a little at one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heavens!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s full of wolves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves!&rdquo; repeated the big hunter, as he finished binding
his cowed and terrified captive to a stake near by. &ldquo;How
many on &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight,&rdquo; returned Clancy, counting. &ldquo;Shall I shoot
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the giant avenger, a sudden thought entering
his mind. &ldquo;We may have use for &rsquo;em bimeby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use for them! How?&rdquo; asked the young hunter.</p>
<p>For answer, the giant pointed to Ku-nan-gu-no-nah!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go and take a look at the prisoners.
They&rsquo;re free now. Thar&rsquo;s two men and a woman;
and one of the men&rsquo;s got on a plug hat and a white shirt
and a swaller-tail coat and a standin&rsquo; collar and a dirty choker,&rdquo;
he went on, as they drew near the liberated emigrants.
&ldquo;He looks for all the world like a preacher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the face of the man described by the giant&mdash;a
smooth-shaven, sanctimonious face, that had not been wrinkled
with a smile for ten years&mdash;was turned toward them, and
the big hunter stopped and stood still in his tracks a moment,
overcome with astonishment, staring hard at the emigrants,
who, with Darke and Wimple, were advancing toward them.</p>
<p>Clancy regarded him with amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Elder Tugwoller! And
oh, Lordy! thar&rsquo;s Sally! My Sally, I mean! Oh, Lord! it&rsquo;s
Sally! <i>Sally!</i> <span class="sc">Sally!</span>&rdquo; he cried, and a moment later he had
picked her off her feet, and was holding her in his great, strong
arms, as if she had been a baby.</p>
<p>She had recognized him when he called out to her, and
flew to meet him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The elder and the other man, as well as the rest of the
party, were regarding them with astonishment. Catching
sight of the stranger, Leander set Sally down as suddenly as
he had taken her up, saying anxiously, as he thought he might
have been hugging another man&rsquo;s wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye married, Sally? Is that yer man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Leander,&rdquo; she replied, throwing herself again into
his arms; and after vainly trying to reach her hands around
his neck&mdash;for she was very short, her head reaching but a little
above his elbows&mdash;she buried her blushing face, not in the
orthodox style in his bosom, but in his fur vestment somewhere
below. &ldquo;No, Leander, I hain&rsquo;t married. I wouldn&rsquo;t
never marry no man but you! I&rsquo;ve had fifteen offers since I
see you last, and I refused &rsquo;em all! I thought we&rsquo;d meet
ag&rsquo;in sometime, the good Lord willin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he <i>was</i> willin&rsquo;, Sally! Yer mine now, ain&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;your&rsquo;n allers&mdash;till the Bunker Hill
monument crumbles to dust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we won&rsquo;t never git things mixed and twisted ag&rsquo;in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;nothin&rsquo; shan&rsquo;t never part us ag&rsquo;in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the long-sundered hearts were reunited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarah,&rdquo; said the Elder, through his nose, &ldquo;are you going
to marry with that ungodly man of strife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, uncle Tugwoller,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to
marry that same ungodly man of strife, an&rsquo; be jist as good a
wife to him as I know how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darke was beginning to evince great anxiety to see his
daughter once more, and the ludicrous reunion of the big
hunter and his old-time sweetheart, that he had just witnessed,
somehow made Clancy long to meet Vinnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the woodman, &ldquo;let us go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a few minits,&rdquo; answered the now happy Leander.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a little bizness to attend to yet. I&rsquo;ve got Ku-nan-gu-no-nah
tied to a stake down thar, and it&rsquo;s about time
he retired from bizness. He&rsquo;s committed crimes&mdash;blacker
ones than ye can imagine&mdash;and he must have his punishment.
We&rsquo;ll give him a trial before we finish him off. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he led the way back to the open space in the center
of the encampment, where, to the same stake to which Ku-nan-gu-no-nah
had so often bound his captives, he was himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
tied so securely that, struggle as he might, he could not
get free, and knowing that his doom was at hand, he had
made superhuman efforts to break his bonds, but without
avail. He was completely cowed; at the last, all his courage
and hardihood seemed to have left him, and he stood, quaking
with terror, his dusky face blanched to an ashen hue!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the big hunter, laying his hand on the Indian&rsquo;s
shoulder, &ldquo;ef any one here has got any charges to prefer
ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; the prisoner at the stake, the court is ready to attend
to the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prisoner pulled off my dicky to-day,&rdquo; said the Elder,
dolorously, &ldquo;and otherwise disarranged my apparel. I think
he deserves condign punishment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But other charges of graver import were to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shot our guide,&rdquo; said Sally Niver; &ldquo;and put his arm
round my waist, when he lifted me out of the wagon, and no
decent man would do that&mdash;unless he had a right to,&rdquo; she added,
with a glance at Leander. &ldquo;I think he ought to be hung
for murderin&rsquo; the guide, anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He killed my brother John!&rdquo; said Wimple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He butchered my old father and mother!&rdquo; said the giant,
&ldquo;and he&rsquo;s got to die an awful death for it! If any one here
thinks he ought to live after committin&rsquo; all these crimes, let
him speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no voice to speak against the execution of the
giant&rsquo;s sentence, and he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall he live or die? I&rsquo;ll give him one more chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him die!&rdquo; was the answer; and almost before the
startled spectators realized what had taken place, Leander
Maybob had cut the thongs that bound the doomed chief to
the stake, and rearing him above his head, hurled him over
the low stockade, among the snarling, half-famished wolves!</p>
<p>Retribution had come at last! He had expiated his many
crimes! The vengeance of Leander and Alonphilus Maybob
was accomplished!</p>
<p>A few moments later, the whole party rode out of the almost
depopulated Indian village, the liberated captives
mounted on some Indian ponies that they had found tethered
near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Darke, we&rsquo;ll go to yer gal!&rdquo; said Leander.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII.</span>
<br />CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p>In a little chapparal not far away they found Vinnie, and
near her, sitting on the ground, was Alonphilus, the dwarf.
At a little distance was tethered the white horse&mdash;there could
be no mistaking it&mdash;the same milk-white steed that had carried
the ghastly form of Meno, the Spirit Warrior, as he rushed
by them a little while before, bearing the girl in his grisly
embrace.</p>
<p>Pete Wimple approached the animal, as it stood quietly
picking at the beaten-down prairie grass, and then kindly
touched it once or twice on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ye doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Leander. &ldquo;Tryin&rsquo; to see if it&rsquo;s
well groomed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I was tryin&rsquo; to make up my mind if &rsquo;twas ra&rsquo;al, ginuine
hoss-flesh, or jist a shadder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a real hoss!&rdquo; said the giant, stooping, while all their
eyes followed every motion curiously, and stretching up the
ghastly length of the bony frame of a large, powerfully-built
man from out of the thick grass at his feet. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the
Spirit Warrior as has killed and scart to death more Injins in
the last six years than ten men could finish off in the old-fashioned
way in ten years! My little brother, thar on the
ground, a-tyin&rsquo; a big knot in the end of that string, ain&rsquo;t very
wide acrost, as ye can see, and the space atween the ribs of
this &rsquo;ere thing is big anuff for him to crawl in all over. So,
when he gits inside of it, and stands upon that white hoss and
flings bomb-shells, and fires off rockets among a pack of reds,
I guess they think he&rsquo;s one of the tallest kind of spirit warriors,
and about the worst <i>accident</i> as ever befell &rsquo;em! I&rsquo;m a
sort of a vantriloquizer, and I uster hide in the woods, and
holler like Meno, the spirit, is said to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darke, leaving Vinnie and Clancy to the enjoyment of
each other&rsquo;s society for a few moments, had come forward
while the giant was speaking, and as he finished, he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that explains the mystery of the oaken chest, also,
does it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all there is of the hull mystery and the hull secret,&rdquo;
said the giant, in reply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo; about it
now, cause I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to marry and retire from bizness. My
uncle Peter&mdash;and he was a unavarsal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your brother is dumb. How did he produce that
awful screech?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alonphilus raised a small, curiously contrived whistle to
his lips, and a moment later, the same wild, terrifying cry
that they had heard before, rung out on the air.</p>
<p>Ten minutes more, and they were again mounted and ready
to set out for the settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarah,&rdquo; said the Elder, in his nasal voice, &ldquo;I ask you
again if you contemplate becoming the helpmeet of that
worldly man of conflict?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Uncle Tugwoller,&rdquo; she replied, sweetly, reining her
horse up by the side of Leander&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll marry us to-morrow,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I must,&rdquo; he said, dolorously, tugging away at the corner
of his disarranged dicky, &ldquo;if I must, and my remuneration
is forthcoming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve triumphed, Sally,&rdquo; said the giant lover, with a
tender intonation on the name. &ldquo;My uncle Peter uster say
as how a female would if she wanted to, and if she didn&rsquo;t,
she wouldn&rsquo;t. I hope the Elder ain&rsquo;t a gittin things mixed
and twisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was after nightfall before the party arrived at the settlement.
At times along the way, the Elder experienced much
difficulty in maintaining his place on the back of his horse.
Once he lost off his dicky, but he bore the trip with surprising
equanimity.</p>
<p>The Elder was alone in the world now, save for Sally, his
wife having died two years before.</p>
<p>With his niece, in company with Henry Black&mdash;the man
whom, in our last chapter, Leander suspected might be the
husband of his sweetheart&mdash;the Reverend Tugwoller was on
his way to join a colony of eastern people then forming in
the far North-west, whither he had been called to act in his
ministerial capacity. Of course now that Sally had so happily&mdash;or
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
unfortunately, he would have said&mdash;met with her
first and only love, and they had been so felicitously reunited,
this plan was abandoned; and the next morning he pronounced
them man and wife, at Pete Wimple&rsquo;s, where the company
spent the night in the presence of our assembled friends.
He settled quietly down with his niece and her husband,
who abandoned the wilderness soon after and took up the
life of a farmer in the interior of Michigan. He tried in
vain to bring Leander to a realizing sense of his innate wickedness,
and began to think at last that Sally might have done
worse, after all, when it came to his knowledge that the beatified
fellow was the fortunate possessor of two or three
hundred acres of fine land, clear of all claims, besides about
five thousand dollars hard cash that his father had received
for his place in the East.</p>
<p>The dwarf dwelt with them and was tenderly cared for by
his giant brother and his kind-hearted sister-in-law, to the
end of his life. He always kept the death-record with the
big knot at one end in commemoration of the terrible charge
of the four men through the Indian encampment and the
awful death of Ku-nan-gu-no-nah, the slayer of his parents.</p>
<p>Clancy and Vinnie were married in due time, and, with
Emmett Darke, they went farther south, and purchasing a
farm lived very happily indeed.</p>
<p>Pete Wimple, the scout, is a gray-haired old man now;
but his eye is as clear and his form as erect as in the days of
yore; and his story of the chase and the war-path are the
delight of all the boys in the settlement.</p>
<p>Death, the blood-hound, died of old age twenty years ago.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
